    "chunk_text": "MOROCCO DIAGNOSTIC\nWhat are the barriers limiting industrial energy efficiency in Morocco? Such barriers were identified by conducting an extensive literature review and stakeholder interviews. Publications by GIZ, GermanWatch, and the Netherland Enterprise Agency provided important inputs for\nclassifying the challenges Morocco is facing about increasing energy efficiency in the industry. Additionally,\nexpert interviews with representative from BMCI, Credit Agricole, Islamic Development Bank, CGEM, MorSEFF/\nAfrica Climate Solutions, Maroc PME, and IMANOR were conducted during fieldwork in Morocco. Each category\nincludes a different spectrum of barriers, which are important to take into consideration when trying to\nimplement energy efficiency projects in Morocco. Lack of awareness\nWorking in the field of renewable energy and energy efficiency is still a quite new topic in Morocco. Hence,\nlocal knowledge and experience is lacking and substantial groundwork continues to be completed. Companies that might have a certain potential for energy savings through energy efficiency measures can\nfind it hard to identify such measures. Most business are poorly informed about the energy issue and possible\nsolutions. No assistance is being offered to companies for identifying possible energy savings opportunities. Companies that have identified energy savings opportunities through, e.g. an energy audit, find challenges\nin how to implement those audit recommendations, as overviews are missing regarding best available\ntechnologies/equipment, businesses offering such services, and concerning financial support. Often a certain company culture is prevailing which through established routines and procedures can easily\nneglect the energy issue. Organizational and behavioural aspects\nEnergy managers or persons responsible for energy in industrial operations are often not in a decision-\nmaking position of the companies. Consequently, top management can easily neglect the energy issue. These companies often observe a high turnover of executives. This pattern in combination with incentives\nfor immediate profits leads to focus on a short-term vision. As a result, energy efficiency often receives no\nconsideration in such short-term action plans, as usually savings from energy efficiency measures do not\nbecome evident over a brief span. Manufacturers are generally reluctant to deploy new equipment into their processes. Absent regulation\nThe statutory framework and institutional infrastructure is lacking in regard to promoting industrial energy\nefficiency."

    "chunk_text": "MOROCCO DIAGNOSTIC\nWhat solutions can address these barriers? Supply chain\nSuppliers are reluctant to introduce new products in the market without evidence indicating significant\ndemand for the new product. The energy service market is seen as novel and insufficiently structured. The quality of services among\ndifferent service providers can vary significantly, making it difficult for consumers to ensure their requests\nare being fulfilled to the best available standards. The energy market has the tendency to fluctuate significantly (especially concerning liquid fuels) and creates,\nthereby, high uncertainties concerning the development of the energy price. Funding mechanism\nThe availability of financing options and mechanisms for investing in energy efficiency are not clearly\ncommunicated to its respective target audience. Businesses are lacking information about available funding\nand the organisation, and procedures seem often unclear to them. Companies see themselves often confronted with complex, numerous, and demanding procedures to secure\nthe needed funding. The sustainability of financial aid programmes is not always guaranteed. Funding is being made available\nfor a limited amount of time and once this support is no longer available, the demand for it declines as well. SMEs are critical for creating demand as they make up most of the Moroccan economy. However, SMEs often\ncannot access conventional debt financing as they lack certain prerequisites, such as providing collateral. Funding does not always seem to be suitable in terms of timing and repayment. ESCO related barriers\nServices an ESCO can provide are mostly unknown to Moroccan enterprises. Therefore, the demand for ESCO\nenergy services is only limited. Due to lack of awareness about the services and associated benefits that ESCOs can offer, commercial\nbanks have low trust in them and see investing in them as high risk. Therefore, other forms of financing for\nESCO activities are needed, e.g. the creation of a revolving energy efficiency fund, state financial and fiscal\nincentives, or other measures to decrease the perceived risk. A regulatory framework around ESCOs and their service offers is missing. Law 47-09 offers a first definition\nof what an ESCO is but does not go any further. 18 | Industrial Energy Accelerator"

Apply the same set of rules and provide the same incentives\nto SOEs\u2019 commercial activities as those offered to private firms (for example, procurement, access to\nland, access to finance). 2.

Harmonize public incentives (such as taxes, subsidies, training) across all exporters, irrespective of\nlocation. 4. Increase the incentives to release land for productive investment and level the playing field among\nprivate players and with SOEs (for example, increase taxation on unused land; improve access to\ninformation on land availability). 5. Reduce import tariffs on consumer goods to reduce protection in the domestic market and incentivize\ninvestment towards export-oriented industries and away from non-tradable sectors. Entrepreneurship and SME development\nIncrease access by new and young firms and SMEs to essential services in order to build robust ecosystems in support\nof productivity, innovation and job creation\n1. Scale-up activities that foster an entrepreneurial mindset such as mentoring, networking, business\ncompetitions; further support and expand the provision of incubation, acceleration and business\ndevelopment services for starts-ups. 2. Expand programs to acquire entrepreneurial skills at all levels of education and mobilize existing talent\nsuch as the Moroccans living abroad. 3. Improve financial access to and viability of starts-ups and existing SMEs by providing financing to along\nthe life-cycle of start-up projects; adopting the crowdfunding law; implementing guarantee instruments\nto inject long term financing for SMEs; and providing credit insurance to SMEs to mitigate the impact of\nB2B payment delays. 4.

It has managed to successfully diversify its production by branching out into aluminum stamping\nfor automobile exports in 2011. The arrival of Renault unlocked new opportunities for the company when\nit won a contract for labor-intensive stamping. Tuyauto has invested in new machinery supported by a\n20 percent investment subsidy from the Maroc PME Imtiaz program. The investment allowed the firm to\nincrease turnover and grow jobs by 50 percent, from 120 to 180. Tuyauto\u2019s growth outlook is uncertain,\nhowever, for two main reasons. First, demand for its product is today heavily dependent on orders from\nRenault; this dependence makes investing expanding capacity by investing in more machines a risky\nproposition. Moreover, Tuyauto\u2019s production is specialized for one car model with a model lifetime of five\nyears. Beyond Renault, there are no other major buyers in local market today; PSA (Peugeot-Nissan) has\nan established relationship with another supplier, Florecia, and is unlikely to shift to another. The entry of\nmore car manufacturers would make the investment in capacity more financially viable. Second, Tuyauto,\nwhich is not physically based in Renault\u2019s cluster or in an industrial zone, is at a disadvantage compared to\nfirms located in these zones.

Towards New Arrangements for State Ownership in the Middle East and North Africa, Paris: OECD Publishing. 30 Following the standard in the literature, market power is proxied using the price\u2013cost margin, which is derived from the Lerner Index. The\nPCM measures margins (that is, the difference between price and marginal cost) as a proportion of price. In the absence of information on\nprice and marginal cost, the extent of pricing power in an industry is proxied by the difference between value added and labor costs as a\nproportion of sales (all measured in current prices), as follows:\nPCMi =\n(salesi - cost - materialsi - labor - costi)\nsalesi\nSales, material cost, and salaries are all taken from the Enterprise Survey. Financial costs of capital are not included in the average costs. 31 Enterprise Survey was conducted in 2013 in Tunisia, and in 2016 for Egypt. 32 A cross-section regression was estimated to explain price cost margin performance using the following firm characteristics as covariates:\nlabor intensity (measured as the number of full time employees), age (measured in age categories), ownership (if foreign owned or not), sector\nof operation (captured through two digit sector fixed effects) and country (captured by Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt dummies). The predicted\nvalue of the price cost margin for Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt, after controlling for all those covariates is displayed in Figure 8. These results\nare robust when restricting the analysis to manufacturing firms only. 33 In an effort to promote competition, ANRT prioritized the issue of local loop unbundling as early as 2004 through a decision resulting in\nnegotiations with the incumbent Maroc Telecom which needed to provide technical specifications about its legacy copper infrastructure\nand pricing options for operator access. However, it was not until an order from the Prime Minister that dates were set for implementation\nof local loop unbundling\u2014with partial unbundling expected by January 2007 and full unbundling by July 2008.

While Article 6 of the Law 15-95 (Commercial Code) establishes\n18 activities identified as commercial acts, some of them could also correspond/be provided as public services, that is, transportation,\ndistribution of water, electricity and gas, or posts and telecommunications. 43 Law No. 69-00 makes no distinction on the SOEs based on the nature of the activity: both institutions with a commercial purpose and\ninstitutions focusing on \u201csocial activities\u201d are included within the scope of application of the law (World Bank 2015). While there is no\ngeneral requirement to separate commercial and non-commercial activities of SOEs, some of them identify \u201cpublic service\u201d obligations for\nwhich they get a compensation. This is the case of RAM that holds different accounting lines for unprofitable routes served on the basis of\nagreements with different regions to ensure connectivity. The lack of separation between commercial and non-commercial activities implies\nlack of separation between costs and revenues related to commercial/no-commercial activities. However, given the advanced accounting\nobligations of SOEs, when there is clarity on the provision of a given good/service as per non-commercial obligation, then costs and revenues\nof this services are clearly allocated. This is the case of non-profitable domestic routes for RAM. 44 There is no general obligation for SOEs to separate commercial and non-commercial activities and this impacts the ability to supervise\nthe allocation of costs and capital return to commercial activities."

SOEs are not accountable for the return of their investments. However,\npositive NPV is required for SOEs when creating a new subsidiary. To do so, SOEs must have the approval of the Ministry of Finance and\nthey are asked to provide a business plan with an estimation of the NPV. Moreover, while SOEs present a positive operating balance as a\ngroup, the amount of operating deficit accrued by under-performing SOEs has increased during the last three years (Minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Economie\net des Finances du Maroc 2017). 45 Only certain SOEs are subject to corporate tax. Although Article 2 of the General Tax Code explicitly subjects \u201cCompanies regardless of\ntheir form and purpose\u201d as well as public institutions to corporate income tax, Article 6 exempts some SOEs from its application. 46 While no reference has been found to preferential rates applied to SOE loans by state-owned banks, the Court of Audits report that\ninternal debt of SOEs is declining and only represents 33.9 percent of total debts by SOEs. In contrast, the Court draws the attention to the\nconsiderable amount of external debt that is being accrued by SOEs in the last years. It is noteworthy that a considerable majority of such\nexternal debt is guaranteed by the state. 47 Some SOEs (either in general or for specific types of contracts) are exempted from the application of the public procurement law (Articles 2\nand 4 of Decree 2-12-349); however, they report to follow similar procedures in order to ensure their position before the Cour de Comptes. For instance, in the case of CDG, the selection of real estate promoters does not follow the general public procurement framework, but they\nissue call for tenders where the selection is based on general criteria of price and quality. Nevertheless, SOEs also enter into a variety of\nagreements with private operators (for example, JVs, concessions) that are expressly exempted from the public procurement law. 48 See Article 2 of Law No."

In the case\nof invoice factoring, invoices are acquired by a factoring company (in Morocco, typically the subsidiary of one of the leading banks) which is\nin turn insured by a credit insurer. Market sources indicate that Morocco could still further expand invoice discounting and factoring. 74 Maroc Telecom has undergone several rounds of privatization, starting in January 2001, when it transferred 35 percent of its capital, and\nthe management control, to Vivendi Universal for MAD 23.3 billion ($2.3 billion). Vivendi\u2019s share increased to 53 percent before it sold it\nin 2014 to Etisalat, the Gulf\u2019s biggest telephone operator, which is majority owned by the Abu Dhabi government (Financial Times, 2013)."

In addition, the state also has a 30 percent stake in Maroc Telecom, one of the\nthree major telecom operators in the country. The state also still owns 60 percent of the port operator Marsa Maroc, which was partially\nprivatized in 2016. 93 About 30 PPPs were undertaken between 1986 and 2017, almost all of them as concessions or involving the delegation of services in\ncommercial sectors, including highways, urban transport, water and electricity distribution, sanitation, household solid waste collection,\nelectricity generation, irrigation, and the management of agricultural land. These PPPs were negotiated either by local collectives or by\ncontract with the state on a case-by-case basis. While urban transport concessions have not all proved successful, concessions for water and\nelectricity distribution and sanitation have shown good results. 94 The first proposal was for the construction and maintenance of the Bab Ouendar Dam, which was rejected. The second was for the\nconstruction, co-financing, operation, and maintenance of a desalination station and a wind park in Dakhla. The project was approved by\nthe commission for preliminary evaluations and the Minister of Finance, and a call for tenders is underway. 95 Although the incentives offered to firms investing in the automotive and aeronautics sectors create an uneven playing field (and contribute to\na more complex tax system via tax exemptions) since they are not available to all investors, it is important to note that their objective is to\nattract the entry of leading firms in support of globally competitive exports. The instances described in Chapter III, an uncompetitive playing\nfield leads to the opposite result, namely protecting incumbents and discouraging of entry of new firms. 96 Terkla, Dawn. 2011."

The automotive industry lacks companies able to design and manufacture press tooling, plastic molds,\nmachining and assembly tooling. Most of these products rely on medium or heavy investment (cast iron foundry, aluminum casting) and\nmore importantly, depth of knowledge. This means that it will be necessary to either negotiate an alliance/joint venture with existing players,\nor provide significant technical support to local players. The development of Tier 2 firms should be based on association with existing\nplayers, or through relocation to Morocco by specialist companies."

    "chunk_text": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nMorocco has long been known as the \u201cgateway\u201d between Europe and Africa, due to its advantageous\ngeographical location at the crossroads of both seas and continents. By positioning itself as a sought-\nafter location for low-cost labour and international manufacturing activities, the country made\nsignificant gains. In recent years, however \u2013 by diverging from low-value-added services and goods \u2013\nMorocco has emerged as a regional leader in the development and deployment of clean energies,\nsignalling a paradigm shift to a more diversified economy. In support of this goal towards economic diversification, Morocco placed innovation and technology\ncreation at the heart of its economic agenda\u2014for many years\u2014in a strategic bid to transition from a\nresource-based to a knowledge-based economy. This effort started out with the National Innovation\nStrategy (2009) before its updated version: the National Strategy for the Development of Scientific\nResearch through 2025. Moreover, the country launched several other initiatives seeking to develop\na favourable environment for innovation, while diversifying support for research and promoting\ntechnology transfer. Technology transfer \u2013 as the name suggests \u2013 refers generally to the practice of transferring\ntechnology in its various subtypes, from the originating party to the benefitting party. Furthermore,\ntechnology transfer can take several forms; it is called either inward or outward technology transfer\nwhen technology is transferred into the entity \u2013 or transferred out to another party, respectively. Similarly, \u2018intra\u2019 or \u2018inter\u2019 technology transfer refers to when the technology is transferred to entities\nwithin the same group, or entities not belonging to the same group. In such cases, entities are usually\nresearch institutions (universities or research centres), firms, or both. With this context in mind, technology transfer in Morocco exists in its various forms, with the current\ndominating narrative suggesting a more focused effort on the university-industry nexus. Indeed, a\nculminative set of initiatives were taken over the years in a bid to forge links between university and\nindustry. Cities of innovation were created within universities in five regions, with more to follow,\nand a sizable number of funding initiatives to support innovative projects and start-ups were\nlaunched."

In February 2022, a National Plan for the Acceleration and Transformation of the Higher\nEducation, Scientific Research and Innovation (ESRI) ecosystem was announced, to work in alignment\nwith the New Development Model of 2021. The plan aims to propel the country along a progressive\npath forward, with strong innovative capacity and high added value across both academia and\nscience, by overhauling Moroccan universities and improving the financial flow into research and\ninnovation. Similar to universities, firms are guaranteed to use some form of technology transfer on a daily basis. The limited empirical data on the technology transfer activities at the firm level in Morocco, renders\na detailed national assessment and diagnosis challenging. However, in accordance with the general\nobservation that firms in developing countries are more likely be importers of technology than\nexporters, it can be assumed that inward technology transfer is the most predominant form in\nMorocco. While there may be exceptions, the lack of supportive examples makes outward\ntechnology transfers unlikely to hold significant weight in the country\u2019s technology transfer\necosystem. Overall, technology-based innovation in Morocco is characterised by using a market-pull\nrather than technology-push strategy. Indeed, Morocco\u2019s most structured and successful technology\ntransfer value chains are found predominately in the mining, phosphate, agronomy, and renewable\nenergies sectors, due to their significance to the national economy. As reported by several studies, significant progress has been made, backed and confirmed by\nstatistics including the number of international publications, patents filed, and start-ups created. However, several gains are short-lived rather than being sustainable in the long run, and the\n7"

At\nuniversity and public research institutions, bridging the \u201cvalley of death\u201d is of particular interest. This\nentails commercialising and promoting research outputs, which is a growing pain not only due to a\nlack of resources, but also because researchers\u2019 understanding of the commercial value of their work\nis inadequate. The lack of absorption capacity from industry, compounded by the difference in\nculture between academia and their respective industries, appears to be a crucial factor as well. At the firm-level, challenges are abundant. Taking the automotive industry as an example, the\nbenefits of offshoring for Morocco are numerous, but perhaps the biggest challenge and\nconsequential opportunity lies in the inclusion of local firms in the value chain, which would ensure a\nseamless technology transfer. Such a challenge becomes more pronounced when labour-intensive\noffshoring activities limit higher value-added creation and meaningful training and technology\ntransfer. From an investor\u2019s perspective, technology transfer activities should be restricted to a\ncertain extent, in order to preserve their competitive advantage. This would result in a balancing act\nwhere Morocco must both seize opportunities to foster the country\u2019s industrialisation, while\nensuring technology transfer is occurring through targeted policies and technical assistance to local\nfirms. Structure of the report\nThis report provides a comprehensive diagnosis of the state of technology transfer in Morocco. Building on previous studies and supplementing with findings from interviews with key stakeholders,\nthis study brings forth an updated outlook based on the latest information gathered through these\nsources. The report is structured as follows:\n- Section 1: provides an overview of the technology transfer ecosystem in Morocco and\ndefines it into its key constituent categories. - Section 2: examines the technology transfer ecosystem in the country with a sectoral lens. - Section 3: highlights the key challenges that impede technology transfer in Morocco. - Section 4: proffers a set of recommendations to help Morocco enhance its technology\ntransfer system. 8"

The country has strived to make its STI ecosystem more interconnected by forging\nlinks between the private and public sector. A few key statistics can describe the STI status in\nMorocco: Morocco ranked 77th in the 2021 Global Innovation Index, R&D financing represents less\nthan 1% of its GDP, and SCImago ranks Morocco 6th in Africa in terms of scientific publications. Countries with a robust track record in STI generally display the following characteristics:\noutstanding universities, a higher proportion of population with a higher degree, developed financial\nsupport and venture capital, developed university-industry links, an enticing environment for\ninnovation through innovation-friendly regulations and policies, proactive policies and incentives to\nattract talent, and an overall favourable environment to do business. To this end, Morocco made\nnotable progress in all these sectors through a series of continuous and progressive reforms and\ninitiatives. Technology transfer is a highly collaborative and interactive process, where various actors such as\nresearch institutions, firms, incubators, accelerators, and civil society work in synergy with each\nother. Technology transfer activities are conducted in Morocco in various forms but two particular\nobservations were at the forefront of this study: firstly, national debate appears to focus mainly on\nuniversity-industry collaboration, inadvertently discounting the potential that local firms hold, and\nsecondly, R&D activities are clustered in only a few cities, putting other regions at risk of being\nexcluded in the country\u2019s innovation and industrialisation efforts. 9"

In accordance with the report, Morocco performed well in\ninnovation outputs, specifically knowledge and technology, but fell short on other metrics such as\nhuman capital and research. For many years, Morocco has expressed its ambition to become a frontrunner in the region in the\nareas of science, technology, and innovation. Unveiled in spring 2021, the country\u2019s New\nDevelopment Model2 laid out the steps the government will take to make Morocco a nation of\nopportunity, entrepreneurship, and innovation. Specific emphasis was placed on the importance of\nuniversities\u2019 role in building a future-ready \u201cskilled Morocco\u201d. A supportive infrastructure is as\nnecessary to create a conducive STI environment as the case of human capital development. Morocco is undoubtedly achieving its plans to improve digital infrastructure. As of January 2021, at\nleast 27.62 million Moroccans (nearly 74% of the population) use the internet, a significant increase\nfrom the 25.32 million registered in the same month of the preceding year,3 thus making Morocco\nthe most advanced market in Africa where internet connectivity is concerned. In 2021, Morocco was\nranked 84th globally and 6th in Africa based on the Digital Quality Index (DQI), which measures digital\nquality in 110 countries based on five criteria: internet affordability, internet quality, electronic\ninfrastructure, electronic security, and electronic government. Similarly, Morocco ranks the 45th\ncountry out of 230 countries globally in mobile data affordability.4\nCognizant of the role of digital infrastructure in promoting Industry 4.0, the country launched the\nAgency of Digital Development (ADD) \u2013 a strategic public entity placed under the supervision of the\nministry in charge of the Digital Economy. The ADD\u2019s primary mandate is to act as a digital\ntransformation catalyst, by overseeing the country\u2019s digital development strategy and promoting the\nshift to digital tools across all sectors."

The ADD certainly lived up to its mission in May 2019, when it launched the AL-KHAWARIZMI\nprogram. Endowed with a budget of 50 million Moroccan dirhams ($5.6 million), the program aims to\npromote research and development in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its application through calls for\nproposed research. The future of AI cannot be underestimated, and it is instructive to note that\nMorocco has an active AI research community. For instance, MoroccoAI \u2013 a network of Moroccan AI\nexperts \u2013 seeks to expand Morocco\u2019s AI transformation and promote AI education and research. Similarly, AI Movement, also known as the Moroccan International Centre for Artificial Intelligence, is\na centre of excellence of Artificial Intelligence established at Mohammed VI Polytechnique University\n(UM6P) that aims to foster the emergence of Moroccan expertise in Artificial Intelligence and Data\nSciences. Several studies have extensively examined the STI activity in the country, and it is safe to say that\nMorocco is paving the way for Industry 4.0. As of Q3 2019, the country boasts 31 Tech Hubs, placing\nit second in North Africa.5\n1.2 Technology Transfer definition\nTechnology transfer is a practice that has generated much discourse over the years, and even more\nrecently in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, owing to vaccine access and equity. However, the\ndebate began much earlier in 1961 at the 1084th plenary meeting, when some developing countries\nrequested the Secretary General to commission a study examining the effects of patents, and its\nlegislations in selected under-developed countries. The request also sought to inspect issues\nsurrounding the granting, protection, and use of patents, considering the provisions of existing\ninternational conventions and the special needs of developing countries.6 It subsequently became\none of the most discussed areas in the international economic spheres, leading to a range of policies,\nframeworks, and partnerships at the national, regional, and international levels. 10"

For instance, Tech Transfer Central defines technology transfer (or Tech Transfer) in the\ncontext of research institutions, as \u201cthe process by which new inventions and innovations created in\nthose institutions\u2019 labs are translated into products and commercialized.\u201d7 The European Commission\ndefines it as \u201cThe process of conveying results stemming from scientific and technological research to\nthe market and to wider society, along with associated skills and procedures, and is such an intrinsic\npart of the technological innovation process.\u201d8 MIT describes technology transfer as \u201cThe movement\nof knowledge and discoveries to the general public. It can occur through publications, graduating\nstudents entering the workforce, presentations at conferences, and research relationships with\nindustry.\u201d9 NASA presents its technology transfer practice as \u201cA programme that ensures that\ninnovations developed for exploration and discovery are broadly available to the public, maximising\nthe benefit to the nation.\u201d10\nIn our day-to-day life, there are numerous examples of technology transfer around us. For instance,\none of the most notable inventions of 2000s was the smartphone, which has since become the sine\nqua non, of modern society. When it was first unveiled by Steve Jobs in 2007, the iPhone made global\nheadlines. However, its invention is not as simple as it may appear. Indeed, the device had six layers,\nand each one was the result of painstaking research.11 Another example is Amazon \u2014 the ever\npopular e-commerce website which started as an online bookstore in 1994, and then expanded into\nother industries such as consumer electronics, cloud computing and entertainment, before becoming\none of the world\u2019s most valuable companies12 and claiming the third spot in the list of the most\ninnovative companies in the world in 2021.13 The company would later lend its platform to other\nbusinesses to sell their products. During this time, it also began offering several businesses the\npossibility to outsource their computing needs, so that they could sell their own products on Amazon\nin exchange for a fee which would later lay the foundation of Amazon Web Services (AWS)."

Technology Transfer, 2022. 1.3 Intellectual Property in Morocco\nIn its general set up, technology transfer refers to the process of sharing intellectual property in its\nvarious forms with both wider society and individual economic actors. Therefore, protecting\ninventions originating from universities, research institutions (public or private), firms, and\nentrepreneurs is integral step to the technology transfer value chain. IP protection offers many\nbenefits, namely helping patent holders to explore different avenues to commercialise their IP by\neither developing, manufacturing and turning it into a source of revenue, or by licensing or\nfranchising it. It also serves to protect the innovator\u2019s product by restricting access to it. Furthermore, it increases chances of cross-border collaboration and allows the exporting of products\nand services (outward technology transfer). It is, however, necessary to note that if IP captures an important part in the technology transfer value\nchain, it is a double-edge sword. Indeed, while weak IPR protection may disincentivise research\nendeavours and lead to the unintentional spill over of sensitive data by the invention\u2019s holder, a\nstrong IPR protection \u2013 on the other hand \u2013 could lead to insufficient knowledge and technology\ndiffusion, thereby slowing innovation. Thus, it is important to strike the right balance whereby\ninnovation is promoted, and the patent holder\u2019s rights are upheld. In Morocco, The Moroccan Office of Industrial and Commercial Property (OMPIC) is the entity\nresponsible for the protection and promotion of intellectual property.

Perhaps most\nnotably, these statistics are derived directly from the EPO-Morocco validation agreement of\nEuropean patents in Morocco \u2013 effected on March 1st, 2015 \u2013 with the chief aim to open Morocco to\nglobal markets and therefore strengthen its economic integration. Indeed, the agreement resulted in\nmore simplicity in the process of patents filing for Europeans in particular. While this result bolstered Morocco\u2019s position in the patenting market, there was a decrease in the\nnumber of native Moroccans filing between 2015 and 2017 which can be attributed to Law 23-1314\nthat was introduced in December 2014. The objective of this law was to modernise and reform the\npatent filing system, giving it superior alignment with international standards while improving the\nquality of patents filed. This was made possible by introducing a set of criteria to selectively attract\nproductive investments with high added value thereby reducing counterfeits in the process. In accordance with OMPIC official figures, the top countries for patent filing during the\naforementioned period (2014-2019) have steadily been the United States, France, Germany and Italy\nrespectively, with new countries that do not commonly file patents in Morocco\u2014such as Turkey,\nChina, and Denmark \u2013 following suit."

In its annually released IP Index, The US Chamber of Commerce Global\nInnovation Policy Centre (GIPC) ranked Morocco 22nd out of 53 countries15 and following this,\nbecame the highest performing middle-income economy in the index. The index evaluates IP rights in\n53 global economies, from patent and copyright policies to commercialization of IP assets,\nenforcement, and ratification of International Treaties.

Despite this vantage ranking, Morocco\u2019s IP environment remains rife with obstacles, mainly around\ncounterfeit. In a recent publication by the OECD, Morocco ranked 16th out of the 25 top provenance\ncountries in counterfeit and pirated goods between 2017-201916, topping the list of African\ncountries.

As an\nexample, Morocco stepped up efforts to establish an Electric Vehicle (EV) industry through a\ntechnology transfer agreement with Brazil in August 202136, an established Moroccan trading\npartner. The partnership is a joint effort between INESC P&D Brazil, a non-governmental scientific\nand technological institution, GEP, Morocco\u2019s Green Energy Park research platform, and the Office\nCherifien of Phosphate (OCP) Group. Under the agreement, researchers in Brazil will develop the\ntechnology, while the Moroccan government will provide funding for the research. The researchers\nwill develop a prototype of the charging equipment in Brazil, and a \u201ctwin\u201d will be created in Morocco. In March 2022, Morocco signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Bahrain, to\nstrengthen bilateral cooperation in the sector of renewable energy.37 The goal of the agreement is to\nmobilise and enhance each side\u2019s expertise and resources to achieve the common goals of\ndevelopment and renewable energies commitments. The focus of the two partners will be on solar\nenergy projects, the development of storage technology and automation, as well as programs to\nstrengthen skills with dedicated training activities and workshops. Similarly, in May 2022, Morocco\nand Saudi Arabia signed a MoU on the peaceful use of atomic energy. The agreement aims to bring\nthe expertise of the two countries in the field specifically as it pertains to designing, constructing, and\noperating of a nuclear fuel cycle and waste management. This also includes the areas of engineering\nand marketing innovative techniques for new generations of nuclear plants.38\nAnother noteworthy example of technology transfer in the energy sector is that of the International\nUniversity of Rabat (UIR)\u2014a semi-public university. With an average of 40 patents filed annually, the\nmajority of its inventions aim to bring about innovation in the sectors of energy, transport and\nmetrology."

It is unclear whether these inventions were transferred to national or foreign entities, however UIR\nremains one of the few Moroccan universities focused on technology transfer activities. 2.2 Agriculture\nMoroccan society depends a great deal on agriculture. In 2020, the agricultural sector accounted for\nabout 11.7% of Morocco\u2019s GDP, behind only the industrial (26.1%) and services (50.8%) sectors.40\nAgriculture is often referred to as a priority sector in Morocco\u2019s development plans. This is partly\nbecause of its importance to the national economy. However, it is also because of the pressure\nMorocco faces to improve efficiency and increase production so that it is better able to cope with the\nserious challenges posed by both demographic growth and climate change. The agricultural sector in Morocco has historically relied on traditional practices and skills. However,\ninnovations in pesticides, fertilizers, irrigation systems, biochemistry, and digitization are bringing\nabout promising change. To fully harness these innovations, new skills are required to understand,\nimplement, and monitor and maintain these practices. With this in mind, Morocco has accordingly taken steps toward understanding and adapting its\nagricultural sector to emerging circumstances.

The new plan aims to consolidate existing\npolicies and work in synergy with other national plans, such as the \u201cNational Plan for Drinking Water\nSupply and Irrigation (2020-2027)\u201d and the INTELAKA program, which offers support and funding to\nMicro, Small, and Medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). One particularity of the new plan is that it puts\nemphasis on human capital development and inclusivity by seeking to upskill and reskill Moroccan\nfarmers (with a view to preparing them to adapt to new technologies), promote entrepreneurship in\nagriculture through financing programs, and support farmers in their transition towards renewable\nenergies and resilient and eco-friendly farming methods.41\nIn terms of technology transfer structures, the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA)\nis the leading agricultural research body in the country, with nine scientific departments and ten\nregional research centres. An autonomous government institution within the Ministry of Agriculture\nthat is responsible for crop and livestock research, the INRA runs programs on genetic improvement,\ngenetic resources conservation, agronomy, machinery, and technology transfer.42\nAnother important research institute is the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P), which\nplays a highly active role in conducting research and driving technological innovation within the\nagricultural sector. UM6P is not only home to the \u201cAgricultural Innovation and Technology Transfer\nCentre\u201d but also the OCP Group\u2019s Research and Development (R&D) Centre. The latter is working to\ndevelop fertilizers attuned to African crops and soils, as well as to formulate service models that are\nspecially adapted to African farmers and which will ensure they have reliable and affordable access\nto relevant data and products. 43 Moreover, in 2019, UM6P entered into an international academic\npartnership with two leading UK agricultural research institutions \u2013 Rothamsted Research and\nCranfield University \u2013 to work jointly on agricultural research projects and set up a doctoral training\ncentre that will support the development of the next generation of Moroccan scientists and\nengineers."

After learning hard lessons from the pandemic, many countries, including Morocco,\nbegan the race towards vaccine self-sufficiency and sovereignty. In early 2022, Morocco began the construction of a manufacturing vaccine plant, to implement the\nSENSYO Pharmatec project \u2013 a partnership between the Swedish company Recipharm and a\nconsortium of Moroccan banks and entities \u2013 with the ultimate goal of making the country a regional\nhub for pharmaceutical and vaccine innovation. The $500 million project with investment over a five-\nyear period is set to propel the country into a new era of health science, and will equip the country\nwith the capacity and capability needed for self-sufficiency. In line with Morocco\u2019s goal towards local manufacturing and industrialisation of medical products\nand solutions, an agreement was penned between the Moroccan ABA Technology Group and the\nMoroccan Medical & Biomedical Industrial Cluster (MMI) in December 2021, under the aegis of the\nMinistry of Industry and Trade.45 In this partnership, The MMI Cluster will benefit from the ABA\nTechnology Group\u2019s robust and varied expertise across engineering, manufacturing of electronic\nboards, and embedded software and plastic injection dedicated to the medical sector.

According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Morocco is the third\nlargest arms buyer in Africa for the period extending from 2012 to 2021, just behind Egypt and\nAlgeria \u2013 and 25th globally, accounting for 1% of global arms imports for the same period.52 The\nUnited States is the country\u2019s top arms supplier, with imports including advanced arms and\nammunition. Beyond imports, Morocco\u2019s bilateral and multilateral defence partnership encompasses multiple\nmilitary exercises, training, counter-terrorism operations, and stabilization participation, by which\nMorocco can strengthen its military capabilities through human and technical interoperability. The\nincreasingly critical role that Morocco plays in sustaining peace and security in what is considered a\nhighly volatile geostrategic environment granted the country the praise of the international defence\ncommunity. Today, Morocco is considered a Major non-NATO-ally (MNNA) and is one of the 15\npartner countries of NATO\u2019s Defence Education Enhancement Programme (DEEP), a programme for\ndefence capacity and institution building.53\nAmid the ever-evolving international context, Morocco places industrial sovereignty across a number\nof sectors as a matter of priority. For years, it has expressed its ambition to develop the defence\nindustry, allowing for relief from its heavy dependence on foreign military equipment and arms. To\nput their proposal into practice, the country enacted Law n\u00b0 10-20 in July 2021, relating to security\nand defence equipment and material, and arms and ammunition.54 The law serves as a framework to\nestablish an industrial and technological basis for the country\u2019s defence industry. The new framework\nspecifically paves the progressive path of establishing private industrial units in the country, thereby\noffering numerous incentives that would enable foreign investors to choose the country. Such\nincentives include VAT exemption on sales for public organs in charge of security and defence and a\npossible derogation from the Moroccan law dictating that setting up a business in the country would\nrequire a mostly Moroccan capital."

Although the road to achieving this in the defence industry is one\nthat is both long and fraught with challenges, the country nonetheless aims to, slowly and surely,\ndevelop its own military industry. Law n\u00b0 10-20 represents a pivotal milestone in developing and\nregulating the industry while incentivising foreign players to establish ties in the country, thereby\ndrawing strategic and economic benefits from it. Another strategy adopted by Morocco to fortify the defence industry is to leverage existing\nrelationships with key trade partners. For instance, in 2019, Morocco and Brazil signed a deal to\nshare military technology; the agreement focuses on several core areas of research and\ndevelopment, science and technology, logistical support and acquisition of defence products and\nservices.55 In another example of defence diplomacy, following the normalization agreement\nbetween Morocco and the State of Israel in 2020 \u2013 and brokered with the US assistance \u2013 Morocco\nand Israel signed in November 2021 a defence memorandum including the exchange of experiences,\nexpertise and technology transfer.56 Other countries understood to have technology transfer\nagreements with Morocco in defence and counterterrorism include India, Pakistan, and Turkey. To duplicate the success of its automotive and aerospace industry exports, Morocco began\nexpressing keenness \u2013 as early as 2017 \u2013 to become military arms and equipment producing country. Such plans finally began to materialise in April 2022. In what has been labelled a \u201csignificant\ncooperation\u201d, Belgian aerospace firms Sabca and Sabena entered into a strategic partnership with\nLockheed Martin, an American aerospace, arms, defence, information security, and technology\ncorporation, to build a new military aircraft maintenance facility in Morocco."

Today, strategic plans are underway to correct the path and\nsolve a number of issues. Some challenges are more complex than others and therefore require\nboth an integrated approach and inter-ministerial cooperation. From the perspective of a research\ninstitution, commercialising and promoting research outputs is difficult not only due to lack of\nresources, but also researchers' lack of understanding regarding the commercial value of their work. Bridging the proverbial \u201cValley of death\u201d has been difficult due to the industry\u2019s lack of absorption\ncapacity, compounded by the difference in cultures between academia and their respective\nindustries. At the firm level, start-ups are the backbone of numerous African countries, but do not play a\ndynamic role in the Moroccan R&D, particularly in technology transfer. This is partly due to stiff\nlegal and fiscal policies and partly due to technology transfer simply not being a priority. For\nestablished SMEs, however, Morocco\u2019s offshoring industry represents a key opportunity to explore\ntechnology transfer opportunities if the necessary pre-requisites are met, such as continuous access\nto financing and capacity building programmes to increase chances of integration in the industry. Overall, the absence of necessary national indicators and a system for tracking, monitoring and\nevaluation to thoroughly understand technology transfer activities in research institutions and\nfirms, calls into question the validity and efficiency of existing mechanisms and data used to design\npolicies. 31"

    "chunk_text": "3.1 The challenge of brain drain\nIn an increasingly global world and ever-evolving tectonic market shifts, we see developed countries\nbecoming both importers and exporters of talent. This is translated in the number of foreign expats\nwe see in developed countries, especially in middle eastern countries such as the UAE. According to a\nLinkedin study63, more talent is now heading to the Middle-East, Africa, and South Africa, showing an\nimpressive reverse of flow. As of 2021, Morocco has the highest rate of brain drain in the Middle-East and North African region\nafter Syria64. The phenomenon is specifically seen among graduates who often, after completing their\nstudies abroad, decide to stay abroad, where several high-skilled and global talent visas offer the\npath for residency and citizenship. The bulk of Moroccan engineers are in Europe, specifically in\nFrance, a choice that is particularly attractive due to the shared languages and historical links that\nmakes cultural integration easier. However, it should be noted that the Moroccan diaspora can more\nrecently be found in the US, Germany, Canada, and the UK; a slight tilt towards English speaking\ncountries from where they hope to head to the middle east and work for Emirati, Saudi, or Qatari\ncompanies. The issue of brain drain is acknowledged and openly debated in Morocco, where retention of local\ntalent is making its place in key strategic plans. Several initiatives were undertaken to address the\npush and pull factors that lie behind the brain drain in Morocco such as unemployment, inadequate\npolicies, poor entrepreneurial system, lack of incentives, inability of the local economy to absorb and\nappreciate talent, and much more. Initiatives have also been taken to encourage the return of skilled\nMoroccans and retain the local talent:\n- To curb the outflow of students to France, some prestigious French schools established\noutposts in Morocco such as l\u2019ESSEC, Centrale, INSA and more, offering the same programs\nthat are taught in France."

While this initiative could benefit Moroccan students by offering\nthem a world-class education and a foreign degree in the comfort of their home country,\nothers are yet to be convinced that this option is as enriching as an experience abroad where\nthey are immersed in a multi-cultural environment and are pushed out of their comfort zone. - Extend a welcoming hand to Moroccans abroad through the FINCOME program: FINCOME,\ntranslated from Moroccan Arabic for \u201cwhere are you\u201d, is a programme that aims to mobilize\nthe skills of Moroccans living abroad; this is achieved through a database of qualified\nMoroccans abroad that are called upon to support research, training and development\nactivities in the country and ensure a continuous flow of knowledge exchange and transfer,\neither on a perennial or limited basis. This will bridge the gap between Moroccans at home\nand abroad and strengthen this bond through various bilateral cooperation projects. Morocco has a devoted a great deal of effort to addressing brain drain, and while some progress has\nbeen made, it remains to be seen whether the initiatives will lead to successful and\nsustainable results. The general sentiment amongst youth is that a move abroad has more to offer\nthan staying home. Whilst opportunities abroad are easily found in some cases due to the local\neconomy\u2019s inability to absorb a large amount of talent, there\u2019s also a long-held belief that those who\nemigrated are living a more fulfilling and rewarding life, assuming that such satisfaction is exclusive\nto travelling and living abroad due to perceptions of a lack of local opportunities. The attraction and\nencouragement of living, studying, and working abroad is a routine topic of discussion within the\nrising talents in Morocco. However, Morocco\u2019s evolution over recent years appears to be largely\nignored in the decision-making process of these prospective talents. 32"

    "chunk_text": "3.2 Lack of funding and incentives\nOverall, policy dialogue on technology transfer in Morocco appears to be primarily focused on\nuniversities. This could mistakenly convey the idea that universities are supposed to assume a larger\nrole in technology transfer systems, while in fact, the process is highly interactive and requires wide\ncollaboration between different partners, including firms. Notwithstanding this dominating narrative,\npublic research institutions (including universities) and firms face the same challenge which is lack of\nfunds and incentives to engage and invest in R&D activities in a substantive way. At the university-level, the role and status of the researcher are not well-defined, specifically where\nresearch output, ownership and commercialisation are concerned. This not only limits the\nresearcher\u2019s scope but also sets them back in the absence of any incentive that would reward them\nfor innovation; it isn\u2019t clear whether universities have in place a reward system or research or\ninnovation-related KPI for career advancement. Additionally, it is not clear whether there\u2019s a unified\nresearch strategy that governs Moroccan universities; the same applies to research budget within\nuniversities, it is unclear how the research budget is allocated. At the industry level, R&D activities inside Moroccan companies remain very limited in the absence\nof incentives such as tax breaks. Indeed, the majority of firms in Morocco rely on technology sourced\nfrom abroad as it is perceived as a strategic choice to cut costs that would have otherwise been\nincurred by long and heavy investment in R&D activities. With that being said, and looking at the\nlocal market overall, the outputs of research & development labs are often too sophisticated for the\nlocal industry to absorb them, resulting in what could be perceived as a waste of time and resources\nor, in the most optimistic scenarios, a long journey to commercialization. 3.3 Cultural difference between university and industry\nIn addition to the challenges aforementioned, cultural differences between universities and industry\npresent another gap that must be bridged. Indeed, the two operate in two different environments\nwith different sets of rules, missions, and mandates (see table below)."

The divergence of culture between academia and industry is quite pronounced in\nMorocco for two reasons. Firstly, the lack of interaction between the two around collaboration is a\nproblem; students find difficulties finding internships in the country because the local economy is not\ndeveloped enough to absorb emerging talent, especially in STEM. Secondly, the concept of \u201clearning\nby doing\u201d or industrial placement is non-existent in the country, but MESRI is exploring it as part of\nits PACTE ESRI 2030. Bridging this gap in culture is particularly important as universities file the highest number of patents\nin the country, but rarely succeed in commercialising them, a task that is often assigned to\nTechnology Transfer Offices (TTOs). The most notable examples of TTOs in the country were\nhighlighted in the previous section, but such structures remain scarce and lack the substantial skills,\nexpertise, and means required to play an active role in assisting universities in commercialisation. To\naddress this, foundations were laid in the first quarter of 2022 to set up TTOs in a number of\nMoroccan universities with the support of OMPIC, which will assist in defining the business and\ngovernance model of developed structures. 34"

A transformational programme\nwas announced in early 2022 by the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Research, and\nInnovation. This initiative would overhaul the Moroccan educational system and transform Moroccan\nuniversities through the adoption of University 4.0, ready to respond to the new global economy and\nassociated technological trends. It is still too early to assess the potential of such strategies in tangibly improving Morocco\u2019s\ntechnology transfer ecosystem; however, an analysis of the current system has unveiled several\nchallenges which require a multi-stakeholder and multidimensional approach. This is in order to\nimprove the existing technology transfer infrastructure and address the internal and external\nvariables that influence the technology transfer value chain in the country. Progress lies first and\nforemost in the hands of the government, and the key actions at the forefront of any technology\ntransfer strategy are as follows:\nYearly or biennial surveys on national technology transfer systems. A multistakeholder committee\nshould be formed to monitor technology transfer activities. Despite previous plans by MESRI to form\nsuch a committee, it has yet to be created. Such a committee would be under the responsibility of\nseveral ministries, including MESRI, MIC, and the Ministry of Digital Transition and Administrative\nReform. The committee should be mandated to commission yearly or biennial surveys on the\ntechnology transfer system in the country, covering both firms and research institutions, creating a\nnational registry for technology transfer activities in the country, and providing policy guidance based\non practices observed both at home and abroad. Create a multitude of educated professionals and entrepreneurs. This goal is two-fold: firstly, it\naims to reduce dependability on external resources and capabilities, and grow and strengthen\ndomestic industry; secondly, it aims to grow the capacity to create innovation and support an\neffective transfer of technologies from the innovation source, to the industry. Address the human capital flight."

    "chunk_text": "Address the human capital flight. Many skilled Moroccans are moving abroad, and this trend has not\nshown any signs of slowing. Whilst mobility is a human right, devoting significant resources to\neducation becomes counter-productive when the developed talent leaves the country. This problem\nshould be addressed from three angles: improving information access about, to, and from the\nMoroccan diaspora; understanding their needs; and adopting a multi-stakeholder dialogue approach\nto design effective strategies to entice and mobilise the Moroccan diaspora to take an active role in\nthe development of the country. Several options should be explored. This includes enlisting their expertise for short-term missions in\nthe country to rebuild ties with their home-country; multiplying the number of worldwide networks\nto ensure continuous engagement and funding, which could be led by Moroccan missions abroad;\nexploring hybrid engagement strategies \u2013 physical, virtual, full-time, and part-time \u2013 to transfer skills;\n35"

Many African countries have enacted start-up bills, including\nSenegal, Nigeria, Kenya and Tunisia, Rwanda, and Ethiopia. Morocco should begin the dialogue on a\nframework that defines the relationship between the government and start-ups. A start-up act would\nencourage the development and growth of start-ups through fiscal and non-fiscal support, while\ncreating a business environment in which government, entrepreneurs, investors, and civil society\nwork together toward a common goal. Subtle debate has emerged in recent years to define the legal\nstatus of start-ups in Morocco. Such a bill would not only address this issue but would also\nconsolidate existing laws on start-ups. Promote the use of the English language in teaching and learning. English is the international\nlanguage of business and research. In Morocco, Arabic and French remain the official languages\nacross the sectors of academia and business, although a limited number of universities offer English\ncurriculums. Introducing multilingual curriculums could promote research collaboration and improve\nemployment prospects. Promote industrial placements. Experiential learning, or \u201clearning by doing\u201d, is virtually non-existent\nin the Moroccan academic experience. An industrial placement could offer an extended period of\nwork experience during which university students can take a hands-on approach in applying their\nlearnings in the workplace, and therefore acquire new skills. Such experiences prepare students for\nthe corporate world and allow students understand the commercial value of innovation. Increase the budget dedicated to research. Although this has been a priority for several years,\ncurrent funding is still not sufficient for generating the expected added value for the country. Encourage research contribution and productivity at the university. This starts with allocating\nsufficient funds for research at the university level and providing appropriate compensation and\nincentives to research participants. In Morocco, the results of publicly funded research and\ndevelopment belong to the institution at which the research was undertaken, as is the case in most\ncountries. However, there are instances where the institution may not have the resources to exploit\nthe result of an invention."

Despite the private sector\u2019s role\nin the conception of many national strategies, such as the Moroccan Innovation Strategy, private\nsector involvement in R&D in Morocco is rare to non-existent. This is often attributed to a lack of\nincentives. Tax credits and subsidies have generally proven effective in inducing a certain degree of\nparticipation of the private sector in R&D, and should be considered here. Better define the structure and legal status of incubators in Morocco. This specifically applies to\nuniversity incubators that occupy various positions inside the university, ranging from support\nservices and small structures \u2013 to large structures with multiple partners. Modern times call for a\nunified model across all universities in Morocco, where all incubators operate under the same\nprocedures and standards. Additionally, incubators do not enjoy autonomy vis-a-vis the university;\nthey are highly dependent on the funding and human resources allocated by the university. These\n36"

Now, it is the leading export sector, with a production and assembly\ncapacity of 700,000 vehicles, making it an attractive and competitive hub linking Africa\nand Europe in the automotive value chain. However, the automotive industry is on the\ncusp of change, with advances in electric and autonomous vehicles, and transformations in\nmobility, lowering the barriers to entry in car assembly, and increasing the need for labor-\nintensive products such as wiring harnesses. We have identified two trends. First, vehicle manufacturers are engaging in the supply of\nraw materials. Second, the reorientation of investment flows and the organization of the\nlocation of production units will allow Western countries to reduce their dependence on\nforeign suppliers, particularly China. Upstream integration, semiconductors, clean energy,\nand batteries are at the center of decoupling negotiations. In an uncertain context, this\nresearch is intended to conceptualize an adaptive integration strategy for middle-income\ncountries in global automotive value chains. 3\n2\n0\n2\ny\na\nM"

It is also the most\nimportant sector for investment in industrial research and development. The Kingdom of Morocco\nhas managed to attract a dense network of tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers and to become an attractive\nand competitive platform in the automotive value chain linking Africa and Europe. As a result, the\ncountry is now Africa\u2019s leading car producer and the second-largest auto exporter to the European\nUnion. With an annual production capacity of 700,000 vehicles, the automotive industry is Morocco\u2019s\nleading export sector, with a turnover of more than $8 billion. The sector created more than 220,000\njobs between 2014 and 2021, greatly exceeding its initial target of 90,000 jobs, which was part\nof the Industrial Acceleration Plan1 in 2014. More recently, the positioning based on electric cars2\nand R&D are signs of a transition of the Moroccan car industry towards specialization in more\nadvanced and complex value chains, with ESG, innovation and local integration goals. However, the automotive global value chain (GVC) faces the semiconductor crisis and other\nshortages, such as critical metals used in vehicle manufacturing, and clean energy. As a result,\nsome General Motors and Ford Motor supply lines have been temporarily shut down. Meanwhile,\nthe German car industry has suffered from the interruption of cable harness supply caused by the\nwar in Ukraine. One of the weaknesses of GVCs is linked to the dependence of car manufacturers on tier 1 and\n2 equipment manufacturers. Compliance with safety, social, and environmental standards is\nadditional pressure for stakeholders in the automotive value chain 3.In Morocco, the value chain\nremains marked by the domination of two foreign manufacturers (Renault & Stellantis), while\nMoroccan SMEs are poorly represented, with little capital and limited ambitions (Amachraa and\nQuelin, 2022). This paper analyzes the challenges of developing the automotive value chain in Morocco\nin an uncertain and turbulent context, and explores how to improve the positioning\nof middle-income countries4 to gain a greater share of global sustainable and responsible\nautomotive production."

GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN IN THE AUTOMOBILE\nINDUSTRY\n1.1 Observing Best Practices\nGVCs fragment production between several key actors and territories (Jones and Kierskowski,\n2001). Each actor specializes in a specific task. The goal is to create final value through intermediate\nadded value (Gereffi and Fernandez-Stark, 2016). Multinational enterprises drive GVCs as principals, around which are assembled layers of suppliers\nof different tiers and the entire chain of subcontractors required to achieve the final product (Gereffi\net al, 2005; Bair, 2008 and 2015; Ryan et al, 2022; Kano et al, 2021). Figure 1\nExample of the Global Automotive Value Chain\nSource: Author\u2019s investigation\nIn a context of advanced globalization and digitalization, these good practices (innovation and\ncooperation: Mudambi et al, 2008; Strange and Magnan, 2018) and these key territories are\nbeing networked globally (Hudson, 2004; Coe & Hess, 2008; Anner, 2015; Hammer & Plugor,\n2019; Coe & Yeung, 2019). However, these GVCs have faced the pandemic and face energy\ncrises, in addition to shortages along supply chains (Amachraa A. Quelin B., 2022; Gereffi et al,\n2022). The United States report, \u2018Building Resilient Supply Chain, Revitalizing American Manufacturing,\nand Fostering Broad Growth\u2019, published in June 2021 by President Joe Biden\u2019s administration,\nidentified five vulnerabilities in global value chains that are accelerating their reconfiguration:\nsemiconductors, batteries, rare earths, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and large-scale utilities. In this context, the report, and another by the McKinsey Global Institute (GSI) titled \u2018Risk, Resilience\nand Rebalancing in GVCs\u2019, suggested a series of measures and solutions including relocation of\nproduction, diversification of suppliers, the establishment of strategic stocks, risk management and\nadaptation capacities, redundancy of transportation networks, and reduction of product complexity. In the case of the automotive industry, the global automotive value chain is still marked by a\nstrong interdependence among principals and tier 1 original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)."

Worldwide, the Taiwanese equipment\nmanufacturer TSMC alone controls more than 50% of the production of electronic chips (IDC\u2019s\nWorldwide Semiconductor Technology Supply Chain Intelligence study, June 8, 2022). Countries and MNEs involved in the development of GVCs have therefore begun processes of\nspecialization, regionalization, and/or relocation (Kowalski et al, 2015; Baldwin and Tomiura,\n2020; Shih, 2020; Gereffi et al, 2022), with ESG targets, because even MNEs are targeted for\ntheir social and environmental impacts (UNCTAD, 2013; Bair and Palpacuer, 2015; ILOT, 2016;\nKano et al, 2020/2021; Ashwin & Kabeer, 2020; Gereffi et al, 2021/2022; Philips et al, 2022). Actions to relocate global value chains lead to a profound critique of GVCs (IMF, 2022). There\nappears to be an imbalance in value sharing between contractors and suppliers in the same GVC\n(Mudambi et al, 2008; Porter and Kramer, 2011; Meng et al, 2020), and a paradox between\n\u2018market\u2019 economic efficiency and \u2018society\u2019 vulnerabilities (Strange and Humphrey, 2019; Kano et\nal, 2021). 1.2 Understanding the Relationship Between Automobile\nManufacturers and Suppliers\nThe relationships between stakeholders in the global automotive value chain reflect the fragmentation\nof automotive production among several countries and companies. The interdependence among\nmanufacturers and tier 1 suppliers is the second major tendency in the automotive value chain. The\nsemiconductor crisis mentioned earlier is a very good example. However, it is still difficult to identify\nthe future strategies of automotive GVCs: fragmentation because of the effects of shortages along\nsupply chains, or regionalization, i.e. a reorientation of investment flows and an organization of\nthe location of production units to allow Western countries to reduce their degree of dependence\non suppliers, particularly China."

To address the heavy dependence of automotive GVCs on Asian\nsuppliers, we have identified numerous mergers and acquisitions among manufacturers and\nequipment manufacturers that have formed more integrated and resilient groups (the acquisition\nof Magneti Marelli by the Japanese Calsonic Kansei, Siemens VDO by Continental, FTE Automotive\nand Peiker, Spheros, Ichikoh by the French Valeo). At the level of manufacturers, we cite the case\nof Stellantis, which formed a stronger group after the merger of PSA Peugeot-Citro\u00ebn and Fiat\nChrysler Automobiles. The automotive industry remains marked by a period of investment in industrial R&D and\nelectric vehicle development. The shortages along supply chains and risks to energy supplies\n(in terms of availability, energy being \u2018green\u2019 or not, and rising energy costs) mark the start of a\nnew phase of automotive investment and cooperation between manufacturers and equipment\nmanufacturers. Upstream integration, semiconductors and batteries are at the center of the\nnegotiations. In general, the relationship between automobile manufacturers and tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers\ndepends on two key factors: (1) power asymmetries among GVC stakeholders; (2) and the degree\nof decoding of the information to be exchanged in the relationship (Strange et al, 2018). The\nlatter includes the complexity of the information involved in manufacturing an automotive product\n(design and process), the ability to codify or systematize the transfer of knowledge to suppliers, and\nthe capabilities of existing suppliers to produce the product efficiently and reliably (Gereffi, 2005). In this framework, automobile manufacturers often provide specifications for the production of the\nautomotive parts and components that go into the manufacture of the final product (examples:\nsafety-relevant parts and, more recently, anti-pollution standards).

So, an automobile\nmanufacturer works with a top-tier supplier that typically has design and innovation capabilities. The top-tier supplier sources components from the second-tier suppliers and so on. In addition to the technical and financial capacity of the tier 1 equipment manufacturer, trust is an\nessential determinant in the relationship between automobile manufacturers and tier 1 equipment\nmanufacturers. To reduce the risk of bad, late or non-supply, automobile manufacturers also impose\nother requirements specific to supplier transactions, such as the equity and financial stability of the\ntier 1 supplier, the method of financing, delivery to a particular location, the use of specific ICT\nsystems and software, or partnerships with suppliers who have already proven their know-how. The control of MNEs also covers financial audit. However, some equipment manufacturers develop\nautonomous systems with exclusivity for a certain time to a manufacturer (for example, Bosch with\nits ABS for Mercedes, or the eight-speed gearbox that replaces the seven-speed gearbox6). These\nrelationships also depend on the institutional environment and the balance sought between the\nreturn on capital injected and societal vulnerability. Thus, the integration of the automotive industry\nat the national level, through the participation of local SMEs, local purchasing, and job creation, has\nbecome an additional requirement for integrating an automobile ecosystem. 2. DETERMINING MOROCCO\u2019S PLACE IN THE GLOBAL\nAUTOMOTIVE VALUE CHAIN\n2.1 Moroccan Strategy and Organization\nThe automotive industry in Morocco is a success story at the global level; it testifies to a positive\ncontribution of global value chains to the development of national economies. The Kingdom\u2019s\nfirst export sector with a production and assembly capacity of 700,000 vehicles, the automotive\nindustry is now a new growth engine for the industrial sector and exports.

Four-fifths of exports are destined for the EU market. France,\nSpain, Italy, and Germany are the main markets.

According to the World Bank and the Ministry of Industry and Trade (2021), the automotive GVC,\nwith the lead companies Groupe Renault and Groupe PSA (now Stellantis), relies on more than 250\ninternational and national suppliers that operate their own local manufacturing plants, including\nlarge companies headquartered in Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Japan, and the United\nStates. For example, the American company Lear, ranked 179 on the Fortune 500 list, operates eleven\nproduction sites in Morocco to manufacture car seats and electrical systems. Chinese manufacturers\nhave taken advantage of the opportunity of the Peugeot plant in Kenitra (North) to integrate into\nthis value chain. Thus, the Chinese group CITIC Dicastal has built its factory in Morocco with an\ninvestment of $400 million and a production capacity of 6 million pieces per year to supply Stellantis\nGroup. Other examples to illustrate the dynamics and diversity of OEMs: Bosch supplies ABS\nand injection systems; Delphi is a specialist in injectors, HP/LP pumps and cooling systems, while\nContinental manufactures tires and injection systems, Valeo manufactures electronic equipment,\nand Novares is an OEM for plastic components. These are indeed major equipment manufacturers\nand are characterized by a presence in many sectors (electronics, thermal, connectors, etc.). In Morocco, more than 95% of companies active in the automotive manufacturing sector have\nmore than 200 employees, which shows that most players are industrial groups and EMN firms. Local players are poorly represented due to the complexity of accessing international GVCs, which\nrequires high capacities in terms of investment and manufacturing standards."

This merger illustrates\nthe dynamics of the automotive sector, with strategic mergers between automotive giants to\nachieve economies of scale and further reduce costs. Figure 3\nAutomotive Value Chain in Morocco (non-exhaustive actors list)\nThe automotive value chain in Morocco is dominated by labor-intensive sub-sectors, such as seat\nwiring and manufacturing, on the one hand, and car assembly plants, on the other hand. In addition,\na small number of companies produce spare parts, such as brake pads and filters. However, the rate\nof local value added is increasing. Proof of real integration in GVCs beyond a simple production\nbase, R&D is rapidly evolving, which has materialized in the entire development of the Citro\u00ebn AMI\nelectric car in Morocco, and the support for the launch of the common modular platform Stellantis\nCMP in Kenitra. The engine assembly began for the same project, and various parts, including\nlamps, steering, rims, and batteries, were integrated locally. In addition, a new model specific to\nRenault\u2019s Tangier plant has been launched, which means full industrialization in Morocco, and more\nsignificant opportunities for suppliers established in the country. After integrating labor-intensive sub-sectors in the fields of wiring and textiles for the European\nautomotive market, Morocco continues its development by integrating car assembly and the tier\n1 supplier network to cover other advanced sub-sectors including metal, plastic, and automotive\nglass, research and development. 2.2 Risks and Opportunities\nSeveral factors have favored the emergence of the Kingdom in the global automotive trade.

This combination of factors creates an environment of trust to attract investors\nlooking to integrate new competitive and sustainable links into their global production networks. In this context, Morocco seems to be very well positioned for the future, given its comparatively\nlow wages, numerous public support measures for free zones (including exemption from customs\nduties and reduced tax rates), the availability of renewable energies, and the improvement of\nthe logistics chain. Morocco\u2019s competitiveness is constantly improving because of the increase\nin volumes generated by the activity of manufacturing and assembly plants of tier 1 equipment\nmanufacturers. We used data extracted from OECD and UN Comtrade databases to measure Morocco\u2019s\npositioning, and calculated the competitive advantage of automotive products. The data reflect\nexport values in 2019 and developments since 2015. The competitive advantage was observed\nfor the top 10 commodities of Moroccan automotive exports in 2019. Passenger cars dominate\nexports. Morocco\u2019s comparative advantage improved by 35% for passenger cars, and exports\nreached $3.44 billion. For auto parts, it increased by 197%, and exports reached $324 million. Public transport vehicles achieved exports of $29.7million and improved competitive advantage\nby 56%. Steering components are the most attractive products; they have gained attractiveness\nwhile the \u2018other parts\u2019 group has increased its attractiveness and reached a high volume. This\ncan be explained by the opening of new production facilities for car assembly plant suppliers\n(the Stellantis/Peugeot plant in 2019), which has led to the expansion of the offer of products\nmanufactured in Morocco. The largest export item is aluminum rims. With a Chinese global market\nleader and a Korean market leader producing in the Kingdom, Morocco has become one of the\nleading exporters for US and EU destinations. Nevertheless, continued pressure on selling prices and regulation have likely led to a decline in\nMNE profits."

In addition, European manufacturers support heavy\ninvestments in industrial electric vehicles R&D. Consequently, the pressure on all suppliers in global\nvalue chains to reduce the prices of their products at the next stage of the value chain will not\ndiminish. Improving the cost structure through outsourcing and nearshoring is a constant topic in\nthe automotive value chain, placing Morocco in the spotlight of MNEs that were not previously\nengaged in the MENA region. However, the rise of Asia and the relative decline of the European\nmarket in terms of the number of new cars sold, have diminished Morocco\u2019s potential to increase\ncritical industrial mass. In this hyper-competitive context, Morocco must have a larger workforce that has the necessary skills\nto develop the automotive sector. The success of the automotive cluster can serve as a promotional\ntool to demonstrate to students that job prospects are better with a technical or engineering degree. Therefore, it is crucial to work continuously to maintain/improve competitiveness.

In Morocco, some automotive suppliers in Tanger have confirmed that producers of spare parts are\nstrongly threatened by the smuggling of Asian spare parts via Ceuta.

Each ecosystem is managed in collaboration with contractors, major global equipment\nmanufacturers, and the Moroccan Association for Automotive Industry and Trade (AMICA). At the moment, the Ministry of Industry, in collaboration with the private sector, is strongly\nlobbying to attract a fourth global equipment manufacturer to help achieve the symbolic goal of\none million vehicles produced per year, thereby increasing the Kingdom\u2019s industrial critical mass\nand competitiveness. In addition, the future EU carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM)\nrepresents a major opportunity to accelerate Morocco\u2019s competitiveness and access to the EU\nmarket by inserting renewable energies (RE) available in Noor (580 MW) and expected in Midelt\n(1600 MW). RE represents 36.8% of Morocco\u2019s total installed electricity generation capacity (10,557\nMW), and is expected to reach 52% in 2030. Since 2014, Morocco has devoted significant resources to the automotive sector. Critical supports\ninclude:\n(1) Local content agreements. Renault-Nissan has signed an impressive development contract\nwith the government, pledging to increase its volume of purchases in Morocco to \u20ac1.5 billion in\n2023, from \u20ac750 million in 2016. The local integration rate is expected to increase to 65% in 2023;\n(2) Protection of the local market. One of the main obstacles to scaling the African new vehicle\nmarket is the continent\u2019s dependence on second-hand car imports. Morocco allows only the import\nof vehicles that are less than five years old, and that comply with the European emission standard\nEURO4 (except for retired Moroccans returning to the country). This ban protects the local car\nindustry from importing cheap used cars. This is a powerful policy measure considering that, for\nexample, the sub-Saharan Africa region imported more used vehicles (764,880 units) than new\nvehicles (734,084 units) in 2017. Since the introduction of the limitation in 2010, the number of\nimported used cars has fallen from 56,000 to 13,000 (2018);\n(3) Modern industrial infrastructure."

TO WHAT EXTENT CAN A COUNTRY POSITION\nITSELF IN A GLOBAL AUTOMOTIVE VALUE CHAIN? 3.1 Last Integration Frontier\nThe global automotive industry continues to grow faster than any other industrial sector. Driven\nby markets, the automotive value chain has evolved a lot over the past 10 years: a period of\nunprecedented investment in industrial R&D and, more recently additional investment in supply\nchains and batteries, the growing role of electronic chips in automotive production, the formation\nof more integrated and stronger industrial groups, and the development of the electric car and\nclean energy. However, the crisis in semiconductors and rare metals is a significant drag on the\ndevelopment of global automotive production. It is one of the weaknesses of automotive GVCs\nlinked to a heavy interdependence between MNEs and tier 1 suppliers. It should be remembered\nthat a country like Taiwan produces more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s semiconductors. Meanwhile,\nChina controls a large part of the production of rare metals essential for the production of batteries\nand renewable energy. The automotive value chain installed in Morocco is now driven by two foreign locomotives (Renault\nand Stellantis), around which is articulated a dense network of tier 1 and 2 equipment manufacturers,\noften multinational EMNs and rarely joint ventures (JV) with Moroccan companies. As a result, local\nSMEs often act only in tier 3 as subcontractors, or even in tier 4. Similarly, the lack of upstream integration capacities in the automotive sector at the national level\nreinforces Morocco\u2019s dependence on Asian equipment manufacturers. Moreover, there are many\nexamples around the world of what can happen if a country becomes too dependent on one other\ncountry or a few MNEs. Therefore, foreign participation, with such a large share, in clean energy\nand electric vehicle infrastructure new investments would be a risky bet. The question is, therefore, to know what Morocco wants to be sovereign. Which link in the chain\nto make more regional?"

And how to avoid that some European and Asian countries and MNEs\nnot have a lever allowing them to exercise such enormous control over the Moroccan automotive\nvalue chain? In this turbulent context, the entire Moroccan automotive industry, whatever its link of\nactivity, must find a good balance between competitiveness and vulnerability, which can include\nsemiconductors but also rare metals, batteries, localized production sites, and many innovation\nservices related to national SMEs and public services. Morocco is a major phosphate producer and has enormous potential in the mining sector, which is\nan asset for developing new rare-earth extraction techniques and for installing a first iron phosphate\nand lithium cathode plant. However, the potential sites for extraction, processing, and battery\nmanufacturing remain to be determined. The evaluation is complex and requires a comprehensive\napproach based on environmental, technological, socio-economic, strategic, and financial aspects. In 2022, British rare minerals mining specialist Rainbow Rare Earths joined forces with OCP and\nMohammed VI Polytechnic University to deepen and develop the best technique for extracting rare\nearth elements from phosphogypsum. Morocco has several priorities: to strengthen existing tier 1 equipment manufacturers and suppliers\n(tier 2 and 3), in order to make them sustainable and profitable (structuring the SME and gradually\nincreasing the industrial mass to reach 1 million vehicles); investing, via a public-private partnership,\nin a new infrastructure of EV battery factories and in mining, processing, and recycling of essential\nmetals (lithium-nickel-cobalt, lithium-iron, and phosphate); diversify partnerships, investments,\nand contractors involved in the global automotive value chain to reduce dependence on the two\n14 Policy Paper - N\u00b0 09/23 - May 2023"

The priority, at least in the short term, should also be to target the domestic and African markets\nbecause there is a demand. EV products can be competitive there provided social stability is\nmaintained, which is severely affected by price inflation. Therefore, investment in clean energy,\nsemiconductors, batteries, and rare metals is a matter of national sovereignty and should take place\nwithin a sustainable and responsible regulatory framework, with continued support for local SMEs,\nR&D, and innovation. Indeed, suppose Moroccan SMEs can ultimately improve their contribution to\nautomotive GVCs through innovation, increasingly efficient processes, and a qualified and creative\nworkforce. In that case, they can thus be recognized as partners contributing more and more to\nthe added value created. To do this, improving innovation capacity requires training, learning, and\ncollaborations between parties. The aim is to manufacture advanced and sophisticated automotive\ngoods locally and sustainably. In parallel, and in order to spread the social impact of global value\nchains, Morocco should launch (1) a national initiative to reduce inflation among the middle class,\nand (2) a program of social innovation and large-scale public services.

In addition, the CSR actions of multinational\ncompanies in local communities and their territories needs a permanent and constructive dialogue.

As a result, the sharing of value among contractors, equipment\nmanufacturers, and local players must be at the heart of the plan to build stable and sustainable\nautomotive production. Finally, reflection on the impact of the automotive value chain on key\nterritories (Tangier and Kenitra in particular) and local SMEs, through the implementation of\nsustainable and responsible investments based on ESG, can open up a new research theme to\nunderstand better the synergies between GVCs and the development of national economies. 3.2 Four Steps\nThrough foreign direct investment and export promotion strategies, countries attract global value\nchains and specialize in creating more value domestically.

The concept of \u2018upgrading\u2019 relates to gains in competitiveness, whereas\n\u2018densification\u2019 involves more local actor integration (SMEs and jobs). Next, countries chart a path\nof learning and growth for SMEs by specializing in complex and advanced manufacturing tasks\nand professional services. Countries that have achieved this objective are buyers of manufactured\nintermediate goods with a higher proportion of services in their domestic value added. In these\ncountries, the quality of training, R&D, and the availability of creative skills are becoming more\nrelevant. The last step for many buyers is to become the manufacturer of the final product by\nswitching to high-value coordination and service tasks, such as R&D and branding. Finally, countries will then become buyers of inputs and components, and sellers in the end\nmarkets. For the content of our research project, we have reconstructed what happened in the\nMorocco automotive industry to restore a plurality of viewpoints on its stages of development. We\ndid not think in terms of \u2018success\u2019 or \u2018failure\u2019, but the idea is to show what happened while revealing\nthe why and the how.

In this way, a circular economy decouples\n\u201ceconomic activity from the consumption of finite resources,\u201d building a resilient system that works for the world and tackles\nsome of humanity\u2019s most pressing problems: climate change, biodiversity loss, waste, and pollution.45\nImportantly, transforming to a circular economy is about far more than putting solar on factory rooftops or increasing the scale\nof recycling of textile waste (though they are key, too). More fundamentally, it will require the industry to manufacture better\nand with less primary materials. Circular models of production will be essential, and will foster innovation in how the industry makes, dyes, and reuses materials. These will also encourage investments in new technologies and machinery and will enable traceability throughout the product\u2019s\nlife cycle. Suppliers that can meet these requirements will find increasing numbers of brands keen to partner with them, as those brands\nseek to address their own challenges\u2014not the least ones that require collaboration and a shared vision along the value chain. 2"

Renewable energy in Morocco\nSoukaina Boudoudouh (L'Institut de Recherche en \u00c9nergie Solaire et \u00c9nergies Nouvelles)\nMorocco's national energy strategy has evolved rapidly to meet the policy\nchallenge of increasing energy demands, environmental commitments and\nreliance on energy imports. As an emerging economy with limited fossil fuel\nresources, Morocco has focused on developing sustainable and local energy\nsources and has set ambitious targets to spur investment in renewable electricity. This is exemplified by the successful development of the world\u2019s largest\nconcentrating solar power (CSP) plant in 2016, as well as a range of efforts in\nenergy efficiency. As Morocco has moved into new technology fields, including\nsolar PV, hydrogen and batteries, it has been guided and supported by new\ninstitutions, including the Institute for Research in Solar Energy and New Energies\n(IRESEN), which focuses exclusively on R&D and innovation related to renewable\nenergy. IRESEN has ensured that the strategic goal of technology leadership has received\nsufficient attention in alignment with the national vision for renewable energy. It\nhas come to play a central role in research and innovation in renewable energy in\nMorocco and also in international co-operation. It develops pilot projects and\nfacilitates collaboration between academia and industry. This institutional\ninnovation has been highly successful and demonstrates the value of fostering\ntechnical expertise within government and co-ordinating the actions of academic\nand private actors. However, this model has also raised challenges of financial\ncontinuity. Country context\nMorocco is the third-largest economy in North Africa by GDP and the third-largest\nin terms of population. It is classified as a lower middle-income country, and has\nper-capita national income 45% higher than the average of all lower middle-\nincome countries and just 18% lower than the upper middle-income threshold. Its\neconomy has expanded robustly in the past two decades at an annual average\nrate of 3.8% between 2000 and 2021, although the rate has been below that\naverage for the period since 2010 at 2.8%."

It managed the humanitarian\nresponse to the earthquake and has a development plan to unlock the\ndevelopment potential of the most affected provinces. More broadly, foreign direct investment has consistently flowed into Morocco in\nrecent years and is increasingly directed towards the manufacturing sector. Various modern industrial niches well connected to global value chains have\nemerged and the country maintained access to international capital markets\ndespite the ongoing tightening of global financial conditions. Exports of cars rose\n27% in 2023 to USD 14 billion. The European Union is Morocco's largest trading partner. In 2022, 56% of\nMorocco's exports went to the European Union and 45% of Morocco's imports\ncame from the bloc. EU imports from Morocco amounted to EUR 22.9 billion, and\nwere led by transport equipment (23.5%), machinery and appliances (21.2%) and\ntextiles (14.3%). EU exports to Morocco amounted to EUR 33.3 billion. They were\nled by machinery and appliances (21.2%), followed by mineral products (15.5%)\nand transport equipment (11.1%). In the global context, Morocco\u2019s human development index score is relatively\nstrong and has risen continually since 1990. It ranks 120 out of 189 countries on\nthis measure, just one place below the \u201chigh human development\u201d category. Morocco is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy, whereby the king has some\npowers to appoint the prime minister and guide policy, in addition to the elected\ngovernment. Energy sector context\nMorocco\u2019s energy system is dominated by coal and oil, and it imports more energy\neach year than any other African country. In 2021, 89% of Morocco\u2019s final energy\nneeds were met by imported fossil fuels, mostly oil. This makes its economy\nparticularly vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil and gas prices."

The country\u2019s\nenergy demand has risen steadily over the past two decades, with electricity\ndemand rising faster than GDP, at an annual average rate of 4%, and other energy\nuses rising at 2%, more slowly than GDP. As a result, Morocco\u2019s CO emissions\n2\nfrom fuel combustion are on an upward trend, rising at an average of 3.5% per\nyear since 2010 and reaching 67 million tonnes in 2021. These CO emissions\n2\ncome almost exclusively from the burning of imported fuel, which is often used in\ninefficient conversion technologies \u2013 coal-fired power plants and internal\ncombustion engines. This means that significantly more energy content is\nimported than is required to replace the same fossil fuels with domestic electricity\nsources, including for use in electric vehicles. This brings a double dividend of\nlowering import bills as well as emissions."

It is accountable for security of supply,\nenergy market rules and authorising and supervising projects. It has a mandate to\npromote energy efficiency and renewable energy. MTEDD oversees the Office\nNational de l\u2019\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 et de l\u2019Eau Potable (ONEE), which is a legally and\nfinancially autonomous public entity with monopoly ownership of the electricity\ntransmission system. It generates around one-third of the country\u2019s electricity and\nis involved in the purchase and sale of all electricity sold via the national grid. In\n2008 a law was passed to create an Energy Development Fund. Morocco has made significant strides in providing universal access to electricity,\nto the extent that it is no longer a major policy focus for the country. This milestone\nwas achieved in 2017, marking a critical success in the nation's energy policy. This achievement distinguishes Morocco from several other countries on the\nAfrican continent and highlights its commitment to improving living standards and\nfostering economic development through reliable energy access. The completion\nrate of the Global Rural Electrification Programme had reached 99.85% by the\nend of 2022. In 2009 Morocco made the strategic decision to maximise the use of its domestic\nrenewable resources to increase energy security and limit CO emissions. The\n2\n2009 National Energy Strategy committed the country to increasing the share of\nrenewables to 42% of electricity capacity by 2020 and improving energy efficiency\nby 12% by 2020 and 15% by 2030. This is in the context of the united goals of\nsustainable development, energy security and independence from fossil fuel\nimports. The renewables target was further broken down into 2 GW of solar, 2 GW\nof wind and 2 GW of hydropower. At the time, Morocco\u2019s installed solar and wind\ncapacity was around 0.2 GW in total, while hydropower was at 1.8 GW."

This clear technology-related goal distinguishes\nMorocco\u2019s renewable energy policies from those of most of its peers in lower\nmiddle-income countries. By developing its expertise and capacity in this sector,\nthe country aimed to seize the opportunity to export know-how and strengthen its\neconomic and political ties with other nations. In addition, by positioning itself in\nthis way, the government viewed its renewable energy strategy as a means of\nstrengthening its attractiveness to foreign investors. The electricity sector in\nparticular needed sizeable investment to modernise and keep pace with economic\ngrowth. The intrinsic link between the 2009 strategy, the reduction of uncontrollable and\nhigh fuel import bills, and the nation\u2019s economic future created a strong alignment\nwith the national vision.

The OCP Group has launched several initiatives to\nenter this market, including investment in R&D to enhance the efficiency and\ndurability of LFP batteries, and strategic partnerships with international companies\nand research institutions to leverage their expertise. Pilot projects are also\nunderway to test the feasibility of LFP battery production in Morocco. IRESEN was closely involved in producing the roadmap for electric mobility in\nMorocco, which outlines a plan for a charging network, charging standards,\nincentives for vehicle uptake and international co-operation to learn from\nexperiences overseas. Alongside market pull policies, the roadmap highlights the\nimportance of funding R&D for technology innovation. It also proposes socio-\npolitical support policies such as public awareness campaigns about the benefits\nof EVs. In 2023 the World Bank published Unlocking Electric Mobility Potential in\nthe Middle East and North Africa (MENA), with a focus on Morocco and input from\nIRESEN. The report broadly supports the roadmap recommendations and could\nlead to further World Bank finance to tackle challenges including technical\nstandards, electricity sales regulation, charging station profitability and a technical\nplatform for integrating the various stakeholders\u2019 data needs."

This is in part because the\nmarket in Morocco is not yet big enough to attract any of the major international\nEV charging providers. The R&D has resulted in the creation of a start-up, iSmart,\nto commercialise a charging station fully designed and developed by IRESEN at\nthe Green Energy Park. It includes technical advances in charging infrastructure. iSmart started its first production line in 2021 and now has two production lines to\nmeet growing demand. The startup plays an important role in IRESEN\u2019s Green\nMiles project, which aims to identify optimal locations for these stations to\nmaximize their utility and accessibility. Sale of iSmart\u2019s business could help\nIRESEN reinvest in new projects in new technology areas. IRESEN has become a strategic foundation for clean\nenergy knowledge and international co-operation\nIRESEN initially received a budget for ten years of operation and this was\nextended for an additional 6 years in 2021. This reflects the value it has created\nfor Morocco\u2019s policymaking and its success in raising complementary funds. Between 2012 and 2019 most of IRESEN's resources came from foreign donors\n(57%), comprising 60% bilateral funding and 40% other foreign co-operation\nagreements. The remaining 43% is from the national budget. The public grant was\nmostly used towards the project calls, while the money from external fundraising\nwent mostly to establishing the research infrastructure. IRESEN\u2019s notable contributions to solar, hydrogen and electric mobility in Morocco\nare all considered to be of national strategic importance for local businesses and\nforeign direct investment. Its projects have led to 34 patent applications since\n2017, and since IRESEN\u2019s foundation in 2012, Morocco has built a much stronger\nclean energy technology ecosystem and has proven it can react to changes in the\ninternational technological landscape."

As was discovered in Morocco for CSP, solar PV and EVs,\nproducts and projects often need adaptation to local conditions to be smoothly\nintegrated with local infrastructure and the local context. IRESEN was able to play\nthe role of \u201cinformed consumer\u201d and develop complementary technologies to\naccelerate uptake, such as home electricity storage systems and EV chargers.3 It\nis difficult for a government to support the achievement of an ambitious renewable\nenergy target without informed opinions and expertise among decision-makers\nand in the domestic scientific community. While international partners can be very\nhelpful, they may not always agree with each other or may not appreciate local\nnuances. Furthermore, international consultants can be very expensive. While it may seem a bold move and requires a budget commitment, the creation\nof a dedicated institution for clean energy innovation can bring significant value. IRESEN was established at arm\u2019s length from MTEDD with a long-term mission\nto pursue technology in the interest of Morocco\u2019s national vision for economic\ndevelopment. IRESEN regularly evaluates the outcomes of its projects to inform\npolicy makers and relevant institutions, enabling them to improve and see the\nbenefits of investing in R&D. A dedicated institution can become a focal point for a new network of researchers,\ncompanies and experts who have common interests and can work together. This\ntends to lead to expansion of this network, especially when backed by a\ngovernment agency like IRESEN and an ambitious target for energy transitions\nthat lends weight and credibility to the projects. The result in the case of IRESEN\nhas been the creation of a strong national innovation ecosystem in the space of a\ndecade.

However, the impressive developments in these areas were\nconditional on IRESEN\u2019s flexible mandate and good alignment with national\nresources, including the strategic orientation of a major state-owned company\n(OCP Group) and domestic resources (solar radiation and phosphate).

Clean energy\ntechnology development in Morocco has responded to a combination of resource\npush, market pull, knowledge management and socio-political support policies. However, in a resource-constrained context, it is shown to be particularly important\nto ensure alignment with dominant national visions, foster international\npartnerships and focus on technologies that do not need to be developed from\nscratch, but where value can be added by adapting them in line with a clear\nnational strategic benefit. In the case of IRESEN, this had particular impact when\nnew information shifted an incumbent company towards more radical innovation\nand away from incremental development of known processes where they had only\nmarginal international advantage. The OCP Group\u2019s pivot to hydrogen from\nrenewable electricity and the potential tie-ups between Moroccan automakers and\na new battery supply chain encapsulate this dynamic. 4 At the same time, good practice on individual projects and strong technological capabilities are insufficient on their own. In\nMorocco, further work is needed to ensure that smaller-scale renewable projects receive the same opportunities as utility-\nscale projects, including enabling new entrants in the market and more community ownership. There remain opportunities to\nimprove co-ordination between the various stakeholders, political groups and ministries to reach a common vision of how\nbest to implement the renewable energy targets."

    "chunk_text": "Introduction\nIn a global environment marked by resumed growth, but still subjected to disrupting threats,\nconstantly changing market conditions and increasingly fierce competition, availing existing and\nemerging opportunities for progress has become a crucial issue for economic strategists. The task is\nso delicate that it calls upstream for rigorous design to ensure downstream smart implementation of\nsectoral strategies, based on efficient management of financial flows, human resources, competitive\nadvantages and relevant territorialization. The tourism sector is no exception, all the more so as it has particular significance at macroeconomic\nlevel (7.5%1 of GDP, 6.6% of active population and 14.8% of revenues of the balance of payment in\n2010). The vital role of this sector is a continuous concern for public authorities that seek to optimize\nthe positive fallouts on growth and job creation. The decision maker is also concerned with achieving\nsustainable development in its economic, social and environmental dimensions, including solidarity\u2010\nbased, and with involving the whole of society in a rising trend on the basis of equity and reshaped\nmanagement of public interest and territory management. The specificity of this sector also relates to its high degree of openness, which enables it to benefit\nfrom the globalization of the processes of service production, funding and consumption markets. This\nopenness also entails for the sector a series of challenges, notably increasing competitiveness, the\ndecline of investment flows and a deceleration of consumption expenses following the recent\neconomic crisis, or due to the uncertainty surrounding the future of issuing countries, especially\nEuropean countries. These profound changes compel us to approach the tourism sector through the\nprism of globalization, which also requires a new paradigm for managing the sector. Moreover, 2010 is a pivotal year for assessing the policy outcome to draw adequate lessons with a\nview to consolidating the gains of the 2010 vision, and evaluating the measures taken in the sector to\nensure efficient ex ante assessment of the new 2020 vision and better prepare its implementation."

In fact, tourist arrivals have witnessed a\ndeceleration of approximately 6% during the last two years, with about 7.9 million tourists in 2008\nand 8.3 million tourists in 2009.

On the cyclical side, the national tourism sector was directly\nhit by the adverse effects of the economic and financial crisis that has affected the main emitter\ncountries since 2008. The austerity plan announced by Spain, France, Germany and the United\nKingdom have also had negative repercussions on household3 moral, which led them to limit their\nexpenses and reduce their travel budgets.

Seaside resorts account for\nthe biggest part of overall tourist offerings, with a share of 23%, placing Morocco in direct\ncompetition with competitive countries in the Mediterranean Basin (Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey). In addition, Moroccan policies for the promotion of tourism investments lack adequate regional\ndimension.

The scope of these shortfalls remains however limited as the variation is\nlow, not exceeding 7%, and because tourism only contributes 6.8% to domestic GDP.

Tourism strategies in Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey\n4.1. The Egyptian Tourism Strategy\nEgypt has launched an ambitious strategic plan to support the development of its tourism sector until\n2022. With the goal of achieving 25 million tourists eventually (an average annual growth rate of\n5.85% compared to 4.30% expected by WTTC12). This represents 250 million overnight stays for an\nincome of $US 21 billion. The measures announced by the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism as part of\nthis plan revolve around two main pillars:\nIncreasing efforts to promote Egypt as a destination:\nIt is about increasing the budget for tourism promotion, which has already reached $US40 million. The responsible ministry is considering in this regard conducting a series of large\u2010scale promotional\ncampaigns, based on professionalism and knowhow of the marketing and public relations companies. The aim is to change the image that associate Egypt with the \"archaeological culture; seaside resort\"\nby representing it as a destination with a variety of assets and tourist products. In addition, the\nstrategy adopted by Egypt in the promotional component, aims to bring out the advertising\ncampaigns from the general monotonic frame, by choosing dynamic targeting campaigns where the\ncontent and messages change several times a year depending on the circumstances, seasons and\nalso the market requirements. Strengthening relationships with major travel agencies in the world:\nIt is to build and strengthen cooperation with the world major tour\u2010operators, especially in the co\u2010\nmarketing field, and this is through the strengthening of the State's contribution in the financing of\npublicity campaigns organized by tour\u2010operators for Egypt in their countries. Cooperation between\nBoth sides can also be realized through organizing \"knowledge\" trips in which the mega\u2010tour\noperators in a given market are invited to delve into the capabilities of the Egyptian tourism sector. Moreover, Egypt is gradually moving towards diversification of its tourism products and the\nimprovement of their quality."

Not to mention the conferences, environmental tourism and religious tourism\nare among the strategic niches covered by the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism as part of its tourism\nstrategy. Particular attention is given to eco\u2010tourism which is considered a future tourism in Egypt. Thus, the\ncountry is enormously working on keeping the sustainability of its tourism. This form of tourism has\nbecome a prime target by investors, particularly in regions that are still untouched, such as Marsa\nAlam and Siwa Oasis. For their part, the authorities are planning to adapt the city of Sharm Al\u2010Sheikh\nto the environmental standards in order to transform it into a green city within the frame work of\n\"the lungs of the earth\" initiative, launched by the World Tourism Organization (WTO). 12 World Tourism and Travel Council"

Furthermore, a centre of excellence was opened in the city of 6 October for training\ntourism executives. The private sector also contributes by the Construction project of the first private\nuniversity of hotels in Egypt, which is the result of Cooperation between the Ministry of Investment,\nprivate operators and the Lausanne hotel school in Switzerland. 4.2. Tunisian tourism strategy\nTunisia has commissioned a study on developing a strategic vision for the tourism sector by 2016. Developed by the International consultancy Office \u2018Roland Berger\u2019, the study's objective is to explore\nnew tracks to help the tourism industry to adapt to new customers\u2019 requirements. The goal is to\nreach the 10 million tourists per year target in 2014 (an average annual growth rate of 7.05% in\ncomparison with 4.50% expected by WTTC), to generate revenues of 5.36 billion dinars worth (that is\n3.80 billion dollars)13, to achieve an occupancy rate of 54.3% and reach 260 000 beds by 2014. The\nstudy resulted in defining five main areas which are the backbone of the 2016 vision for tourism in\nTunisia:\nDiversifying supply and encouraging innovation:\nAs for the diversification of tourism supply, the focus will be on developing a quality charter called\n\"Jasmine\", creating a Tunisian label \u2018eco\u2010garden\u2019 and launching a nationwide competition calling for\ninnovative projects. Broadening the range of tourist products also includes the creation of free and\nuntaxed zones and development of new types of accommodation such as camping, guest houses and\nmore encouragement of niche products such as Thalassotherapy, tourism conferences, golf and\nhealth tourism. Strengthening promotional activities:\nRegarding promotion and marketing, strategic study recommendations include the adoption of the\napproach of public relations\u2010lobbying and the creation of an international event such as a festival or\nsports competition that could benefit the tourism richness in Tunisia."

Developing web\u2010based tourism:\nIn terms of developing \"web\u2010based\" tourism, measures are being considered to rebuild the NOTT\nwebsite based on three main areas (general public, intranet, extranet), and launch an \"Archipelago\"\nprogram to improve the referential keywords of the Tunisian tourism heritage and support the\nlaunch of commercial sites. 4.3. Turkish tourism strategy\nAs part of its 2023tourism strategy, Turkey aims to reach 40 million tourists (an average annual\ngrowth rate of 12.86% in comparison with 5.08% expected by the WTTC) and a hotel capacity of 1.5\nmillion beds as of the year 2013. The strategy also plans to raise the tourism receipts of foreign origin\nto 50 billion dollars and those from domestic tourism to 20 billion, thus leading to securing an\naverage income of 1,000 dollars per tourist. The main axes of the Tourism Strategy can be illustrated\nas follows:\nDiversifying tourism products:\nConsidered as a \"low cost\u201d destination for a long time, Turkey wants to attract more travelers with\nhigh incomes, while positioning on new niches of high potential. Thus, the focus will be on spa\ntourism, winter tourism, ecotourism, conference tourism and sports tourism. Strengthening infrastructure:\nThis is to solve the problem of deficit in aviation, road and Railway infrastructure to ensure access to\nareas with high tourism potential. Efforts therefore are focused on strengthening and modernizing\nthe existing airport infrastructure, while allowing the construction of new airports. As for the road\ntransportation to the main tourist areas will be fluidized and secured by the construction of new\nsections that will connect these regions to national motorway network."

The 2020 vision major trends and objective analysis\nOne of the great merits of \"Vision 2010\" is that it has lead to a deep transformation in the tourism\nindustry in Morocco. The remarkable acceleration of flows and tourism investment, particularly from\n2004, confirms the new place now occupied by the Kingdom on the international stage. In addition to\nthis vast projection into the world of tourism, \"Vision 2010 \" has helped in making this sector a real\nengine of the Moroccan economy, as evidenced by its significant socio\u2010economic benefits, in terms of\nrevenue and employment. \"Vision 2010\" ends then with an overall positive outcome. Benefiting from\nthis experience, the Government has launched a new strategy for tourism; it is the \"2020 Vision\". The \"2020 Vision\" aims at doubling tourist arrivals by tripling the number of international travelers,\nto reach nearly 18 million tourists given the scenario of end 2010 (9.2 million tourists), which places\nMorocco among the top 20 tourist destinations in the world (the country occupies the 26th position\naccording to the classification of WTO14 in 2009).

    "chunk_text": "Thus, the implementation of the strategy would achieve an annual growth rate average of 7.2%, a\ngain of 2.7 points compared to the baseline (4.5%) abstracted of the 2020 Vision. In absolute terms,\nthe strategy would attract 4.1 million tourists more compared to the change in the baseline scenario. It worths stating that the 2010 vision has ensured a growth rate of an average annual of 8.5%; that is\n1.3 points higher than the 2020 strategy, despite the years of crises 2001, 2008 and 2009 reflecting,\nthus, a potentiality of doing more in the year 2020. To meet this growing demand, the 2020 Vision targets 200,000 new beds out of an overall capacity of\nalmost 374,180 beds, or an average annual growth rate of 7.9% which is in line with the expected\nincrease in the number of tourists (7.2%). This rate is slightly higher than that realized in 2010 (6.9%),\nas it conjunct with the delay in the implementation of the Plan Azure which partially due to financial\nproblems15. Furthermore, the 2020 Vision has set a goal of generating a $US 140 billion MAD revenue, which\ncorresponds to an average annual growth rate that does not exceed 9.6%, roughly the same as the\nbaseline. To put it in a concrete way, revenue to date should range between MAD 98.29 billion\n(discount rate of 3.6%16) and MAD 114.84 billion (2% discount rate17), which is a real average annual\ngrowth ranging between 5.8% and 7.5%. This cautious expectation of tourist revenue reflects the\ngeneral trend of the tourists\u2019 behaviors towards shorter stays; that is, a number of nights smaller and\nlower expenditure. Thus, it seems necessary to encourage tourists to lengthen their stay through\ndiversified packages combining classic destinations (Agadir, Marrakech ...) and less popular\ndestinations especially in the hinterland."

    "chunk_text": "CONCLUSION\nAfter analyzing the results of the 2010 tourist vision, the demographic changes expected by 2030, the\nprospects of the global tourism market by 2020 and the strategies implemented by our competitors\nfor the next decade, it seems that the national tourism sector will evolve in a changing environment\nthat involves implementing a smart tourism strategy, \"2020 Vision\", based on efficient, integrated\nand productive management of financial flows and human resources. The success of this management would depend on improving the productivity of all the value chain\nfrom industry related sectors relative to transportation, hotels and catering sectors to distribution of\ngoods and services. Mastering this process depends on increasing the efficient use of new\ntechnologies, the degree of innovation and good governance to strengthen the competitiveness and\nsustainability of the sector. Thus, it is necessary to develop and innovative approach based on market diversification and\nsegmentation, which can be achieved by dividing actual and potential customers into homogeneous\ngroups and by designing tourism products and meeting the needs and expectations of each group. Indeed, the trend in tourist behaviours20 for 2020 will increasingly involve new experiences and less\nfamiliar destinations combined with specific needs. It is therefore necessary to develop tourism\nproducts that are tailored to the needs and expectations of each customer segment. The senior segment is most promising and requires a wide range of tourism products that meet the\nneeds of this customer category (accommodation offerings, packages and cruises, security and\naccess to medical care ...). Efforts should also focus on the youth segment through the development\nof a product line taking into account the preponderance of Asian and South American young couples. Also, it is important to introduce a generational approach in the design of tourism offerings for\nfamilies. Thus, a single package may contain product\u2010specific needs for each family member (parents,\ntheir adolescent children, grandchildren or even care services). And finally, it must also open up to\ntourists from more traditional or conservative cultures interested in Moroccan history and culture\n(tourists from emerging markets in general and Muslim and Arab countries in particular)."

This pricing review should in no way overshadow product quality, which should be enhanced based\non a new classification system for hotels to enable the domestic accommodation capacity to meet\nthe international demand for quality services. To this effect, the Ministry of Tourism and the National\nFederation of Hotel Industry signed a Memorandum of Agreement with the WTO to support the\nimplementation of such classification and improve quality control of accommodation services in\nMorocco. As far as the distribution plan is concerned, it is important to develop an aggressive multichannel\napproach involving several actors in the distribution of Moroccan tourism products (tour operators,\nspecialized tour operators, physical agencies, and online travel agencies). Particular attention should\nbe given to the development and modernization of each of these distribution channels so that they\nfulfill their role effectively and efficiently.

    "chunk_text": "PREFACE\nIn November 2018, at an international conference, the European Training Foundation (ETF) initiated\na dialogue on how global trends such as digitalisation, globalisation, migration and climate change are\nimpacting the education and employment systems in developing and transition economies and on how\nsuch countries can respond. The conference \u2013 Skills for the Future: Managing Transition \u2013 concluded\nthat monitoring and understanding evolving skills demand is an essential component in how countries\nshould equip their societies for the future. The ETF and its partners found that countries could best anticipate emerging skills needs by\ncombining both traditional methods of data collection and analysis with newer approaches made\nincreasingly possible through data science. The ETF commissioned the present study as part of its follow-up to the conclusions reached at the\nconference. It is one of several surveys, studies and analyses ongoing and pursued by ETF experts in\nskills demand, all aimed at gathering and analysing information on evolving skills needs. It investigates\nhow various drivers of change \u2013 principally technological \u2013 impact skills demand in the agri-food\nsector, and how education and training will need to adapt to meet those needs. The choice of the\nsector was based on several considerations. First, in many countries, including Morocco, the\nagricultural sector employs a substantial share of the workforce, both directly in the fields and\nindirectly, in food processing, for example. Second, agri-food is typically considered to be a labour-\nintensive but low-skilled sector, with limited use of advanced technologies. Accordingly, the take-up of\nnew technologies such as precision agriculture techniques may well have disruptive consequences for\nskills demand and employment numbers in the sector. Third, the use of new technologies in the agri-\nfood sector has important implications for environmental sustainability. This study concentrates on changing skills needs and documents changes in the occupational\ncomposition of jobs resulting from technological change. In other words, it looks at how the skill\ncontent of jobs is changing. It does not assess potential changes in the volume of labour or skills\ndemand or number of workers in the sector resulting from technological change."

The focus is very\nmuch on identifying the skills which people working in the agri-food sector will increasingly need to\nacquire. The study also provides information on how companies adapt to technological change and\nacquire the associated skills. As such, it gives an indication of how supply of skills is keeping pace\nwith technological advances in the sector. Ultimately, the aim of the study is to raise awareness about\nchanges in skills demand and stimulate discussion among policy-makers and practitioners in the field\nso that the findings can inform the adaptation of education and training provision, for example in\ncurricula, teaching and qualifications. The study is one of a series of studies that the ETF has been implementing in its partner countries\nfocusing on economic sectors that present niches of innovation and potential for further development. It is based on a new methodological approach which combines traditional research methods (desk\nresearch, data analysis and interviews) with the use of big data text mining techniques. The use of big\ndata analysis is gaining traction in skills research. Despite some limitations (e.g. coverage,\nrepresentativeness and applicability), it provides new insights as well as real-time information on\nrecent trends and complements more traditional approaches to skills anticipation. By using a mixed\nmethodology, the research can offer insights that might otherwise be missed. The result is a\nconsistent set of findings corroborated by different research tools on emerging trends related to\ntechnology and skills. THE FUTURE OF SKILLS \u2013 MOROCCO | 3"

    "chunk_text": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nIn many countries, the agricultural sector is important, accounting for a substantial share of overall\nemployment both directly and indirectly through its links to food processing and food distribution. This\nreport focuses on the agri-food sector in Morocco. Activities that take place in the agri-food sector in\nMorocco are those which involve farming and the sale of products from Moroccan farms to final\nconsumers. As such, it involves the processing of produce from Moroccan farms into food for sale. This will include, for example, the processing of Moroccan-grown sugar beet into sugar, the\nproduction of orange juice from oranges, and the pressing of olives to make olive oil. It thereby\nincludes value-adding activities related to agriculture. It forms an ecosystem whereby agricultural\nproducers are interlinked with food processing ones. The agri-food sector is not readily identified\nusing the statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community (NACE \u2013\nNomenclature statistique des activit\u00e9s \u00e9conomiques dans la Communaut\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne). It includes\nagriculture (NACE Division 01) and parts of the food processing sector (classified under NACE\nDivisions 10 and 11) but excludes forestry (NACE Division 02) and fishing (NACE Division 03) since\nthey require a completely different set of skills to those of farming. From an occupational point of\nview, the focus has been on those job profiles and skills which are likely to be affected by ongoing\nand future technological change. The overall aim of the study has been to identify as far as possible\nthe sector\u2019s emerging skills needs. Agriculture in Morocco has accounted for around 12% of gross domestic product (GDP) over the past\nfive years and around 33% of employment. Low productivity and low incomes drive people out of\nagriculture, leading to falling employment in the sector. Employment fell from 45% of total\nemployment in 2006 to 38% in 2019 but remains much higher than the share of value added it\nproduces. Agri-food as a whole is particularly important in rural areas. It is estimated that currently\naround 4 million rural inhabitants are employed in agriculture."

    "chunk_text": "It is estimated that currently\naround 4 million rural inhabitants are employed in agriculture. On the other hand, the food processing\nindustry has a more limited but increasing workforce, as around 141 000 people work in the sector at\nthe national level. The agri-food sector accounts for around 21% of total exports. The sector plays a\nkey role in rural development and food security in Morocco. It is also a sector which faces major\nchallenges, not least soil erosion and degradation and drought which blight agriculture. There are\nalso large disparities in the performance of large farms compared with their smaller counterparts. Given its economic importance and the nature of the challenges it faces, the agricultural sector has\nbeen subject, over the last decade, to policy making which has addressed productivity, employment,\nand the climate change/green agenda. One of the most important public policy interventions has\nbeen the Green Morocco Plan (Plan Maroc Vert) 2008\u20132020. Launched in 2008, it was designed to\nsupport the development of the agricultural sector by fostering closer links between farms and\nindustry, and stimulating the formation of cooperatives between farms. Given the dominance of small\nfarms \u2013 70% of farmers own less than five hectares \u2013 cooperatives have been regarded as an\neffective means of developing the technical and managerial skills the sector needs, along with\nimproved access to finance, modern production systems, and marketing. The plan \u2013 which drew to a\nclose in 2020 \u2013 was expected to create over one million jobs and triple the income of rural\ninhabitants. There are other initiatives that have focused more on the agri-food industry, such as the\nNational Pact for Industrial Emergence (Pacte national pour l\u2019\u00e9mergence industrielle, 2009\u20132015) to\nTHE FUTURE OF SKILLS \u2013 MOROCCO | 4"

In spring 2020, a new strategy for agriculture \u2013 G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Green \u2013 was launched. The new strategy,\nwhich covers the period to 2030, will build on the achievements of the Green Morocco Plan to further\nconsolidate growth and social improvements in the sector. It focuses particularly on human capital\ndevelopment, increasing the revenues of farmers through investments, and widening access to social\nprotection for workers in the sector (the Decent Work Agenda). The strategy is also intended to make\nthe sector more attractive to young people either as an employment destination or a focus for their\nentrepreneurship. It also continues to support the creation of new agricultural organisations/\ncooperatives and the adoption of new technologies in the production process. Agriculture, considered part of the agri-food sector, is a sector that has relied on traditional\ntechnologies and associated skills for decades. Now, the challenges imposed by global trade and\ncompetition, climate change and sustainable farming, changing consumer behaviour and diffusion of\naffordable new technologies have all resulted in the sector undergoing a series of radical changes\nacross the globe. The Moroccan agri-foods sector is no exception. The capacity of the agri-food\nsector to be a driver of growth is dependent on it possessing, among other things, the human capital\nto facilitate the shift to more effective, environmentally sustainable production systems, and improved\nmarketing and distribution which will afford better access to international markets. This is where the\ncurrent study has a role to play. It provides an assessment of current and emerging skills demands in\nthe agri-food sector in Morocco resulting from the various changes that the sector is undergoing. Research method\nThe study used a mixed methods approach, using the following:\n\u25a0 analysis of reports and statistics which reveal something about the evolving demand for skills in\nthe agri-food sector in Morocco;\n\u25a0 big data analysis employing text mining techniques to capture data on emerging technological\nchange (and the factors underlying that change) and associated skills needs from a variety of\nsources (e.g."

Big data analysis,\ncombined with insights from desk research and interviews, identified the following drivers of change\nin Morocco\u2019s agri-food sector:\n\u25a0 Globalisation has had a positive impact on innovation and the modernisation of production\nprocesses. But increasing international trade in agri-food products and reduced tariffs have also\nresulted in the abandonment of some product markets because of price competition from other\ncountries. \u25a0 Regulation, government incentives, and taxation. National and international rules and standards\naffect the agri-food business, from farm production (e.g. the regulation of pesticide use) to\nmarket distribution (e.g. where goods need to be kept at a certain temperature). Additionally,\ngovernment programmes, such as the Green Morocco Plan, G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Green, and agropoles,\nhave supported the development of the sector. Finally, taxation and trade tariffs also affect\ncompetitiveness. \u25a0 Aridity is a problem. During 2018 and 2019, Morocco has been hit by severe droughts which\nhave affected both production quantity and quality. Related to this, climate change, which will\nlikely worsen water scarcity, efficient water management (as a response to aridity and climate\nchange) and environmental sustainability (e.g. issues related to energy production and waste\nmanagement/reuse) are further driving change in the sector. \u25a0 Crop improvement. The development of new varieties of plants increases their resistance to\nwater stress, disease and pest infestation. Thus, crop improvement is becoming more important\nin the sector. \u25a0 Technological innovation, mainly related to improving efficiency, reducing costs and raising\nproductivity levels, has been increasing since 2008 thanks to government measures such as the\nGreen Morocco Plan. \u25a0 Quality, identity preservation, and consumer awareness (national and international).

The analysis of patent data suggests that innovations in irrigation systems, biochemistry and\npesticides and fertilisers have been relatively commonplace (as indicated by the relatively large\nnumber of patents filed) and are likely to bring about future change in the agri-food sector. There are\nalso a range of other technologies/technological processes which the text mining analysis indicates\nas being important to the sector in Morocco. These are:\n\u25a0 data acquisition and analysis\n\u25a0 solar thermal devices (solar collector, heating devices, heat carrier medium)\n\u25a0 chemical separation techniques (flash and column chromatography)\n\u25a0 telemetry for reducing energy consumption\n\u25a0 harvesting machines for precision farming\n\u25a0 image acquisition\n\u25a0 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)\n\u25a0 microwave reactor\n\u25a0 wireless technologies\n\u25a0 pumps for irrigation systems\n\u25a0 drive mechanisms\n\u25a0 preventive maintenance\n\u25a0 sealing\n\u25a0 valves (isolation valve, control valve)\n\u25a0 material treatment\n\u25a0 hydraulics systems\n\u25a0 information technology (IT) systems development\n\u25a0 genetics, biochemistry, biotechnologies\n\u25a0 robotic arms\n\u25a0 automation\n\u25a0 automatic measurement devices for packing and transportation\n\u25a0 chemistry and green chemistry\n\u25a0 mechanical press\n\u25a0 raw material extrusion\n\u25a0 sensors (biosensors, remote sensors, microsensors)\n\u25a0 nanotechnologies.

If these technologies are to be adopted, the workforce will need to acquire the skills to operate\nthem. Identifying new skills needs\nThe capacity of the agri-food sector to obtain maximum benefits from the new technologies listed\nabove depends on the availability of skills to facilitate their introduction, use and maintenance. To\nidentify the skills attached to the technologies, a further round of text mining was undertaken using\ntwo online databases which contain detailed information on occupational skills profiles: (i) the\nmultilingual classification of European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO)\ndatabase, and (ii) the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) database from the USA.

These are:\n\u25a0 technical or technology-related occupations, such as engineers and technicians in various\ntechnological areas, especially those related to the value chain, quality control, maintenance,\nand energy efficiency; data analysts and computer programmers; agriculture-related\nprofessionals such as agronomists, soil and plant scientists, irrigation specialists and food\nscientists; certain categories of machine operators and skilled craft workers; and agricultural and\ntransport labourers;\n\u25a0 business services and related occupations, such as renewable energy consultants and\nrepresentatives; food managers; different types of production team leaders, such as agronomic\ncrops, horticulture and fruit; and horticulture production managers. The analysis shows that the professional and associate professional occupations most likely to be\naffected by technological change are water plant technicians, biochemical engineers, sensor\nengineering technicians, bioengineers, water engineers, fluid power engineers and wastewater\nengineers and technicians. It is not just professional and technician jobs that will be affected, but also\nmedium-skilled occupations related to day-to-day farming such as pump operators. The impact of\ntechnological change will increasingly affect people working at all levels in the sector. The new skills needed to master the interface with new technologies will also affect the role of more\ntraditional jobs in agri-food such as agronomists and food specialists. While the set of skills listed by\nESCO for that occupation range from using pesticides to developing irrigation strategies, the\ninformation collected from the interviews with key stakeholders and employers revealed that\nagronomists will have to possess a wider range of knowledge than before, including, for example,\nprecision agriculture techniques (e.g. monitoring sensors and interpreting data). Also, the skills\nrelated to the ongoing changes towards diversification, quality improvement, exports to foreign\nmarkets, and upgrading along the value chain will reshape existing profiles in a range of production,\nmanagement and sales jobs.

Interviews with key stakeholders and companies\non their experiences of technological change and the emerging skills needs were used as the second\nstep to assess how the new skills are obtained by companies. The results from the interviews with\nkey agri-food stakeholders revealed the following findings. \u25a0 All the sector representatives confirmed that the sector is undergoing a period of advanced\ntechnological change as outlined by the big data analysis. \u25a0 There are various factors which may constrain growth in the agri-food sector, from the high\ncapital investments needed to acquire new technologies \u2013 which are out of reach for smaller\ncompanies/farms \u2013 to the shortage of skills needed to manage ongoing changes. \u25a0 Recruiting people with the skills needed to adapt to technological change can prove difficult for\nfour reasons: the relatively low attractiveness of the sector compared with positions in the public\nsector that require similar levels of skill; many highly skilled workers (including engineers) leave\nthe country to work abroad; in some regions, agri-food establishments are located far from\npopulation centres; and there is a varying level of supply coming from the local education and\ntraining system. \u25a0 Strategies to recruit people with the right skills range from recruiting new graduates from\nuniversities after an internship period, to recruitment through head-hunters and also using job\nadvertisements. For smaller businesses, word of mouth is also a solution. \u25a0 Many companies are training their workforces (upskilling and reskilling) so that future skills\nneeds will be met. This is an investment for both companies and society but the cost of which is\ncarried mainly by the employers. \u25a0 More training/education centres dedicated to agri-food are needed if future skills needs are to be\nmet.

    "chunk_text": "Final conclusions\nBased on the analysis contained in the report, the following policy conclusions emerged. 1. There is a need to adopt an integrated vision and push for greater convergence between\nagriculture (upstream) and food processing (downstream). They are managed by different\ninstitutions at a national level, but if a vision for the agri-food sector is to be fully developed and\nrealised, there will need to be much more convergence/integration between those authorities\nresponsible for the constituent parts of the agri-food sector. 2. The major challenges facing the agri-food sector are clear enough in the report: manage climate\nchange, increase productivity, capture high value added segments of global markets, and\nincrease the supply of skills the sector needs to name but a few. Meeting these challenges will\nrequire increased investments in research and development. 3. There is a need to support the transfer of new technologies to farms of all sizes through sectoral\nassociations, cooperatives, and/or public institutions such as the Office National du Conseil\nAgricole. It will be important to demonstrate the benefits of investing in new technologies such as\nclearly signalling the economic benefits to be gained from, for example, using solar power to dry\nfood. In some respects, what is important here is changing mindsets, i.e. persuading producers\nto be more open to innovations of one kind or another, given that the failure to change may\nultimately threaten the viability of their current businesses. 4. The aggregation of small farmers was one of the key elements of the Green Morocco Plan. This\ndirection should be pursued even further to promote different types of collective organisations. For example, the economic interest group (groupement d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9conomique) can play a\nsubstantial role in regional development, as they put together traditional units that otherwise\nwould not be able to ensure quality. However, they should be provided with more capacity in\nterms of number of experts, and with incentives to compensate for higher costs than in the\ninformal market. 5. Human capital development needs to take place simultaneously with technological change as\nthe two elements are inter-dependent."

Accordingly, there is a need for improved information\nabout and diagnosis of skills and training needs. The current study has made an important step\nhere in demonstrating the information which can be used to undertake such a diagnosis. This\ntype of skills intelligence needs to be converted into a process for identifying training needs. 6. In considering how training and education needs relevant to the sector can be satisfied, there is\na need to think about innovative, efficient and effective means of delivery. Online delivery tools\nare important here. More practical (e.g. laboratory) activities are also relevant, especially to\ncomplement higher education curricula. But it is not just about the means of delivery. There is\ncontent to think of as well. For instance, Morocco wants to increase the volume of its exports\nwhich, in turn, points to training and skills needs related to international cooperation. 7. Interviews pointed out that the main gap in human resources is not at university level, but is\nlinked to vocational education and training (VET) graduates, due to a limited capacity of the\neducation system to provide enough technicians with the appropriate competences coupled with\npractical training. The ability to attract and retain young graduates is another key issue. 8. To overcome the shortage of skilled professionals, a good practice that could be further explored\nand possibly mainstreamed is that of sectoral federations creating specialised institutions for\ncontinuing training.

    "chunk_text": "1. INTRODUCTION\nThe pace of technological advance in the world today often appears daunting. Speculative\npredictions point to huge swathes of jobs being replaced by automation in the guise of robots,\nartificial intelligence routines, and so on. In reality, the impact of technological change on\nemployment is often much less sensational. Some jobs will be lost as a consequence of\ntechnological change \u2013 this has always been the case \u2013 but other new jobs will be created too. These new jobs may, as yet, be unknown to us. Thirty years ago, many of the jobs available today\nwould have been beyond people\u2019s imagination at the time. But if advantage is to be taken of\ntechnological change, then an indication is required of types of jobs and the skills they will give rise to\nin the future. Technological change will only take root in a country if the skills are in place that will\nlead to its introduction in the first instance, and then for it to be used as effectively and efficiently as\npossible so that its value to the economy is optimised. The danger of not introducing new\ntechnologies is that an economy, or sector, will fall behind that in competitor countries. Anticipating the skills needs associated with technological change faces two key challenges. First,\nthe pace of technological change is such that predicting its future trajectory poses a number of\nproblems. Second, if there is uncertainty about technological change, this makes it even more\ndifficult to identify emerging skills needs. It is worth mentioning at this point that the pace of\ntechnological change in practice is often slower than some commentators would have one believe. It\ntypically requires relatively large-scale investments by companies who, understandably, are often\ncautious with regard to the likely returns. This tends to slow the pace of diffusion. Nevertheless,\nofficial statistics and surveys which capture information on fixed capital investments by companies\nand the skills needs resulting from technological change are sometimes dated by the time they are\npublished. Often, they provide information on what the situation was a few years ago. Policy-makers\nideally want much more up-to-date information."

Technological change is pervasive. It has the capacity to affect all sectors and all jobs in one way or\nanother.

METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH\nThe purpose of this study is to understand the drivers of change affecting the agri-food sector in\nMorocco, ascertain the technological changes which are either taking place or about to take place,\nand identify the resulting skills needs. The study is about understanding the links between\ntechnological change and skills demand so that policy-makers can better respond to emerging skills\nneeds. The initial research questions that provided the framework of the study are shown in Box 2.1. BOX 2.1 SPECIFIC RESEARCH QUESTIONS\nQuestions about the state of development in the analysed sector\n1. What is the relationship of the selected subsector to the whole sector and the broader\neconomy, e.g. production, employment and export? 2. What are the main drivers of change currently shaping the sector, e.g. trade, global\nvalue chains, new technologies, digital tools greening of the economy and climate\nchange? 3. What has driven/generated innovation in this part of the sector and does it have the\npotential to become an influence on the rest of the sector? Questions about the empirical evidence on the changes occurring in the sector\n4. What are the ongoing changes observed in the sector in terms of production, storage,\nmarketing, business practices, labour and skills utilisation? 5. What are the main occupational profiles used in the sector? Has the content of some\noccupations evolved as a result of the above changes in the sector, and if so, how? 6. Which new tasks and functions have emerged in the jobs and/or occupations in this\nsector? Which old ones have disappeared? 7. What are the differences in the job profiles of this innovative sector? What changes are\nobserved in the profiles of new recruitments and job vacancies published? 8. What is the impact of these changes on labour and skills demands in the sector? Do\nchanges require higher levels of the same skills or completely new sets of skills from\nworkers? 9. How do these changes affect \u2018skills utilisation\u2019 and working conditions in the sector,\ne.g. salary, contracts, working hours and formality? 10."

    "chunk_text": "2.1 Defining the agri-food sector\nActivities that take place in the agri-food sector in Morocco are those which involve farming and the\nsale of products from Moroccan farms to final consumers. As such, it involves the processing of\nproduce from Moroccan farms into food for sale. This will include, for example, the processing of\nMoroccan-grown sugar beet into sugar, the production of orange juice from oranges, and the\npressing of olives to make olive oil. It forms an ecosystem whereby agricultural producers are\ninterlinked with food processing. The agri-food sector is not readily identified using NACE (the\nstatistical classification of economic activities in the European Community \u2013 see Glossary for more\ndetails). It includes agriculture (NACE Division 01) and parts of the food processing sector (NACE\nDivisions 10 and 11). The Venn diagram in Figure 2.1 shows the interlinkages between the agriculture and food processing\nsectors with the shaded areas depicting the agri-food sector. FIGURE 2.1 VISUALISATION OF THE MOROCCAN AGRI-FOOD SECTOR\nThe present study encompasses all food types coming from farming activities, from cereals and fruit\nand vegetables, to meat and dairy products, and all company types, including small, traditional,\nfamily-run activities, large and often highly mechanised farms, and cooperatives. The study does not\ninclude subsistence agriculture as it is used to satisfy the need of producers and therefore not\ndestined for commercialisation. It also does not include fishing, because although it is related to\nhuman nutrition, its workers must possess a different and distinctive set of skills. It is important to note that a substantial part of the strategies to develop the sectors are related to the\nlogic of creating a business ecosystem. The Green Morocco Plan 2008\u20132020 has certainly boosted\nthe agri-food sector, mostly on the production (agricultural) side, while G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Green will focus\non enhancing the value of production. Moreover, the creation of agropoles2 has built a bridge\n2 Agropoles offer various services to producers and are specifically designed to support the value chains in\nvalue creation and export growth.

BOX 2.2 STEPS FOLLOWED IN THE STUDY\u2019S MIXED METHODS APPROACH\n1. Use of well-established methodologies derived from social science, including:\n\u25aa a literature review of the agri-food sector in Morocco, and\n\u25aa secondary analysis of employment and skills data, in particular in the sector. 2. Big data analysis in relation to the agri-food sector in Morocco:\n\u25aa text mining applied to a large volume of documents such as patents or scientific\npapers connected to agri-food to identify the upcoming technologies and other\ndrivers of change, and\n\u25aa comparing and matching the list of relevant technologies extracted from text\nmining to the related occupations and skills listed by the occupational databases\nof ESCO* and O*NET*, by using semantic matching algorithms. 3. In-depth interviews with companies and key stakeholders in the agri-food sector and\nfocus groups to verify and refine the results of the two previous steps. * See Glossary for more details. The first step of the study involved reviewing the literature on the innovation, employment and skills\npool in Morocco. This was followed by a description of the agri-food sector. This contextual analysis\ndemonstrates that the capacity of the sector to introduce the latest technologies does not rest only\nwith skills policies, but also with obtaining investment capital, having links with research institutes,\nand offering relatively good jobs to attract those with the necessary skills. The second step is that of text mining, a technique that allows computers to extract, discover or\norganise relevant information from large collections of different written resources. The textual\ndocumentation produced by industries, institutions, research centres and the like offers a vast\namount of information which is often scattered across many sources, the sheer volume of which\nmakes it impossible to collate and analyse through manual searches."

For scientific papers, both Scopus (by Elsevier) and Web of\nScience (by Clarivate) were used, the two largest databases of peer-reviewed papers, where an\nequivalent study was performed on around 70 million scientific papers. In addition, white papers,\npolicy papers, project reports and foresight papers from Moroccan and international institutions were\nsearched using standard queries and downloaded to be analysed. But there were fewer of the latter\ndocuments and they were also unstructured, so were not as relevant as patents and papers. The data was processed with proprietary algorithms to harmonise names of inventors, authors,\ncompanies and universities, and to consolidate the geo-localisation of parties according to the\nnomenclature of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) codes. The latter is clearly relevant for country-\nspecific studies. To maintain the focus on Morocco, two types of patents were selected: those issued\ndirectly by the Moroccan Office of Industrial and Commercial Property, and international ones for\nwhich at least one of the assignees was located in the country. Papers were selected if Morocco was\ncited among the countries of interest for the study. Semantic algorithms were able to recognise\nfunctional concepts rather than simple keywords, so they were used to scan the full text of each\ndocument to identify those with a main focus on agri-food. Documents from as far back as 1948 were\nretrieved, but for many analyses, data from only the last 10 or 15 years was used. This is a good time\nwindow given the rather long cycles of agriculture, and restricting to even more recent periods would\nhave obscured most temporal trends.

In the second phase of text mining, the information identified was compared and matched to the\nassociated occupations and skills listed in ESCO and O*NET by using semantic matching algorithms\n(i.e. algorithms able to find semantic connections between different concepts based on contextual\ninformation). For example, each occupation in the ESCO database included a description and a list\nof competences, skills and knowledge considered relevant (either essential or optional) for that\noccupation. The semantic algorithm looked for matches of each technology with all the concepts\nassociated with that occupation. When a match was found, the occupation was considered\nassociated with the technology. The entire procedure was automated using ESCO\u2019s Application\nProgramming Interface (API), which allowed occupational data to be downloaded. If an occupation\nwas impacted upon by a technology at any level, then the text mining found it. If no match was found\nin ESCO or O*NET due to emerging (future) jobs or new skills needs, other approaches \u2013 e.g. connecting the new competences through Wikipedia \u2013 were used to try to identify them. The main advantage of text mining is the ability to search a very large number of documents quickly. In particular, patents and scientific papers are easy to access and structured (compared to social\nmedia), so information extraction is facilitated. Although information may be scattered over many\ndifferent documents, algorithms are able to discover hidden patterns and emerging phenomena\nwhich might not be detected by manual search techniques. By correlating concepts and extracting\ntrends, it allows weak signals to be detected and emerging trends to be spotted (see Figure 2.2). This gives a future-oriented perspective and hints at what is not already known from the past. Anticipating the future from the extrapolation of past trends, even with the most sophisticated\nforecasting models, is likely to fail if the phenomenon of interest is subject to rapid and disruptive\nchange."

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, focus group discussions were\nconvened online in June 2020 involving relevant stakeholders from the agri-food sector and the\neducation and training system. Around 60 representatives from government institutions, academia\nand research, as well as public and private associations and organisations, attended the focus group\ndiscussions. The purpose was to reflect on the results from the previous steps. After the focus group,\nface-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted between June 2020 and November 2020. A semi-\nstructured interview technique was used to guide the discussions. A final validation event with main\nstakeholders was organised in November 2020. 2.3 Qualitative data collection\nThe first set of interviews was undertaken with key stakeholders in the agri-food sector.

This led to around 40 Moroccan companies being selected. The list was manually revised to check for duplicates or for mergers and acquisitions and to ensure\nvariety across subsectors. Finally, the national expert integrated the list with other candidates, and\nthe resulting companies were contacted. In total, 13 companies were interviewed from the sector, covering the widest possible spectrum of\nagri-food activities and including enterprises of different sizes and types. The questions focused on\nhow companies deal with the process of technological change (including barriers to its\nimplementation such as shortages of capital and skills), and the impact on the content of jobs and the\nrelated skills needs emerging from these changes. The names of the interviewed companies as well\nas the individual names are kept confidential for data privacy reasons. Collecting the views of key stakeholders and interviewing the most innovative companies was an\nimportant step since new skills demands can be revealed only by understanding the responses of\ncompanies to the signals about emerging technologies. Arguably, by interviewing the most innovative\ncompanies, one may not provide a fully balanced picture, but the study wanted to collect evidence on\nhow technological changes, if implemented, affect employment and skills. The research therefore\nneeded to interview companies in the vanguard of technological change, so to speak, so that the\nimpact on skills demand could be identified. 2.4 Use of mixed methods in practice\nIn general, there was no contradiction between the results from the text mining and interviews. Combining different research methods brought some advantages, as no single methodology can\nidentify all the emerging skills needs in the agri-food sector. Different techniques complemented one\nanother, each compensating for the potential shortcomings of the other. The results from different\nresearch tools were then compared and verified.

But it is\npossible that some innovations are not patented. Moreover, patents are mainly linked to\ntechnological innovation. Non-technological innovations are also important; the review of\nscientific papers and interviews with companies and stakeholders captured other drivers of\nchange. \u25a0 The analysis of skills was limited to those associated with technologies and other trends\nidentified by the text mining. If a certain technology was linked to occupations and skills at high\nor medium level in ESCO and O*NET databases, this was captured. There were several cases\nwhere this link did not exist (e.g. incomplete descriptions of skills). For example, agronomists are\nnot yet linked to precision agriculture in the ESCO database, but the company interviews\nshowed that agronomists that are sought after have to possess this new knowledge. It could be\nexpected that links might be missing more frequently in the case of medium- and low-skilled\noccupations. \u25a0 If there are completely new (future) occupations and skills needs, they have not been found in\nthe existing ESCO or O*NET databases. In these cases, other non-conventional data sources\nsuch as Wikipedia were used to access and identify information beyond the traditional structured\nones, when considered non-exhaustive. However, it is clear that the information provided by\nthese types of sources should be handled with care. Despite these limitations, the data science approach brings some added value. It builds on the\nconventional forms of skills analyses such as undertaking skills surveys and carrying out skills\nforecasting. It allows identification of the skill content of jobs in the agri-tech sector and possible\nchanges of skills with new technology. Thus, the focus is on actual jobs and how these will change\nover the short to medium term, rather than broad aggregations of jobs into occupations. Data is\ncaptured on specific skills in specific jobs rather than total demand for certain occupations.

OVERVIEW OF THE AGRI-FOOD SECTOR\nKEY ISSUES\n\u25a0 This chapter looks at recent trends in the Moroccan economy and changes in the\noverall demand for and supply of labour and skills. \u25a0 Employment in the Moroccan agri-food sector is also reviewed, along with drivers\nof skills demand in the agri-food sector. The purpose of this chapter is scene setting. It provides an overview of recent developments in the\neconomy of Morocco and how this has affected the overall demand for employment and skills,\nfollowed by the employment and skills developments in the Moroccan agri-food sector \u2013 both its\nagricultural production arm and that relating to processing, packaging, marketing and distribution. The chapter demonstrates that the agri-food sector is an important one in Morocco given the levels of\noutput and employment it accounts for. Additionally, the chapter points to several elements affecting\nthe performance of the economy and labour market over recent years. Key among these is the\neducation and skills system which has struggled to provide the country \u2013 and its population \u2013 with\nskills that have value in the labour market. This is not to say that the education and skills system is\nthe principal factor constraining the development of the economy or agri-food sector. Rather, this is\nan issue of particular importance to the study on which this report is based. As the economy adapts\nto technological trends and attempts to shift into higher value segments of the global economy, there\nis a danger that skills shortages will inhibit any such shift. This may be particularly acute in the agri-\nfood sector given the relatively low skills levels of many of those working in the sector today. 3.1 The economy\nEconomic growth in Morocco has been relatively strong in recent years and was largely unaffected\nby the 2008 economic crisis. As shown in Figure 3.1, GDP growth from 2008 to 2018 was\nconsistently positive unlike that of other countries in the Maghreb which were hit harder by the\npolitical turmoil of the Arab Spring and its economic consequences. In the recent past, Morocco has\naveraged GDP growth of around 3% a year."

    "chunk_text": "number of other structural weaknesses in the labour market which succinctly encapsulate the current\nsituation. 1. Lack of inclusion: young people and women are not well integrated into the labour market. While\nmany young people are staying in education for longer, the relatively high levels of youth\nunemployment point to people leaving education and training struggling to find jobs. The rate of\nlabour force participation by women is low: 22% in 2018 compared to 71% 2018 for men10. 2. Job creation has been insufficient to absorb the rising number of young people entering the\nlabour market. In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises have struggled to support\nemployment growth. 3. A large share of employment is in the informal sector which indicates that job quality and\nproductivity are low. It is apparent that much of the growth in non-agricultural employment has\nbeen in low-skilled work (World Bank, n.d. b). 4. Graduate unemployment. Possessing a degree in Morocco does not seem to confer increased\nprotection from becoming unemployed. The report (ETF, 2017b) also highlights relatively low levels of educational attainment on exit from\nthe education system which stymies the further development of human capital. As can be seen from\nTable 3.1, Morocco compares unfavourably with the European Union (EU) on some key measures\nrelated to human capital development. This is turned to next. Occupation and level of educational attainment are proxy measures of skill. Figure 3.3 shows levels\nof educational attainment in Morocco. It shows that a large share of the active population did not\ncomplete compulsory education, accounting for around 6.48 million people in 2018. The share of\npeople without a qualification was even higher among self-employed people, who accounted for\nmore than 40% of employment in the agricultural sector in 201811. When looking at skills demand, the occupational data for Morocco \u2013 see Figure 3.4 \u2013 shows that\noverall a relatively small share of the population is employed in relatively high-skilled jobs (certainly\nwhen compared to the average situation in the EU)."

    "chunk_text": "3.3 Skills\nA problem frequently mentioned by commentators is the relatively low level of educational attainment\namong the population and workforce. According to the World Bank (Chauffour, 2018), in 2018 there\nwere approximately 600 000 Moroccans aged 20, of whom 400 000 had not passed the\nbaccalaureate exam and were therefore low skilled, with limited prospects of finding relatively good-\nquality employment. Projections indicate that of the 200 000 young people with a high school\ndiploma, only 50 000 will receive adequate training to secure a job in line with their expectations,\nwhile roughly 140 000 will acquire skills that have little value in the labour market. An estimated\n10 000 young people (less than 2% of people aged 20 in 2018) will obtain degrees likely to lead to\nhigh waged employment (ibid.). These estimates \u2013 projecting the future educational outcomes of the\nsystem in place in 2018 \u2013 tend to underline how the education system is often far removed from the\nneeds of the labour market. If left unchecked, this will potentially impose a severe constraint on the\nfuture development of the economy and labour market. Morocco has sought to invest in education and skills. The evidence shows that Morocco invests a\nrelatively high share of its GDP in education: in 2016, expenditure on education was 4.7% of GDP,\nslightly below the average of 5.1% found in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment (OECD) countries (ETF/Badescu, 2019)13. This accounted for 23.6% of total\ngovernment expenditure, which is almost double the average share in the EU (12% in 2016)14. The\nmajority of government expenditure on education is directed towards secondary education (42% in\n2009) and primary education (38%), while tertiary education accounts for 20%. These levels of\ninvestment reflect the government\u2019s stated aims to improve the education of the population and\nimprove their living conditions."

Improvements in the quality of education and its inclusiveness are\nregarded as central to tackling Morocco\u2019s main social challenges, such as high youth unemployment,\nilliteracy, and the differences between urban and rural populations (OECD, 2018). In 2018, 94% of Moroccan children were enrolled in their final year of primary school, compared with\n82% in 2008, signalling a reduction in school dropouts15. Figure 3.5 reveals how enrolment rates at\nall levels increased from 2006 to 201816.

The International\nMonetary Fund commented that dropout rates are still high, with 72% of all students leaving the\neducation system without any qualifications in 2016. Furthermore, the skills students acquire in the\nschool system appear to be insufficiently matched to the needs of the labour market and to the need\nto boost employment in higher value added activities (Blancher et al., 2016). 13 https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.XPD.TOTL.GD.ZS?locations=MA\n14 https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.XPD.TOTL.GB.ZS?locations=MA-EU\n15 https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.CMPT.ZS?locations=MA\n16 Enrolment rates are calculated by dividing the number of students of a particular age group enrolled in a given\nlevel of education by the number of people in the population in that age group.

More than one-third of the\nworkforce is found in the sector. Much of this employment is concentrated in relatively low-skill, low-\nvalue work which has proven difficult to change. But it is not only agriculture which reveals productivity\nlevels stagnating; the same situation applies to industry which, like agriculture, has not been able to\nboost its share of GDP (African Development Bank, n.d.).

It therefore includes the commercial production of food by farming and\ntechnologies related to agriculture, horticulture, and food and drink processing. Besides farming and\nagriculture, the sector is linked to the processing, conversion, preparation, preservation, distribution,\nand packaging of foodstuffs. Bearing this definition in mind, a description of output, employment and\nskills in the agri-food sector is now provided17. Development of the agri-food sector\nAs previously mentioned, agriculture accounts for almost 40% of the total employment and 12% of\nthe total value added in the country.

    "chunk_text": "Similarly, food processing is also an important economic activity in Morocco. In 2018 the food\nprocessing industry was Morocco\u2019s second-largest industrial subsector, accounting for 25% of the\ntotal industrial GDP with revenues over MAD 100 billion (EUR 9 billion) (EU Delegation to Morocco,\n2020). In 2016, the food processing industry employed 141 000 people, organised in 2 050\nestablishments, representing 23% of the industrial workforce18. The agri-food sector plays a key role in the rural development and food security of the country, but in\ndoing so it needs to overcome a number of challenges. These include (African Development Bank,\n2019):\n\u25a0 soil erosion and soil degradation;\n\u25a0 drought, often coupled with inefficient water management systems;\n\u25a0 disparities between large and small farms due to parcelling of property;\n\u25a0 lack of sufficient sectoral investments (both from the public and private sectors);\n\u25a0 lack of proper diversification of crops;\n\u25a0 large dependence on exports towards third countries (Europe and North America especially). In terms of international trade, agriculture accounted for approximately 20% of total imports and\nabout 21% of the country\u2019s total exports in 2019 (ibid.). In 2018, vegetable products accounted for\n9.3% (USD 3.12 billion) of all exports, followed by foodstuffs (any substance used as food or to make\nfood) at 6.7% (USD 2.24 billion). Among foodstuffs, the most prominent products exported are\nprocessed fish and processed crustaceans, which together account for 64% of all exported foodstuffs\nwith a total export value of USD 1.4 billion in 2018. Processed vegetables, fruits and nuts accounted\nfor around USD 220 million, around 10% of the export value for all foodstuffs. The food processing\nindustry has particular ties to specific Moroccan regions, with the Agadir area being particularly\nrenowned for the presence of fish processing plants, and the Marrakech, Casablanca, F\u00e8s and\nMekn\u00e8s areas being particularly active in the domain of processing vegetables and fruits."

Over the years the Moroccan government has put in place a range of policies to sustain the\ndevelopment of agriculture and food processing sectors. For instance, the country has made water\nresource management more transparent for users by requiring information on water resources to be\nmade publicly available so that resources are used more efficiently (World Bank, 2019b). Moreover,\nas a result of efforts by authorities to diversify exports and decrease the dependence on Europe \u2013\nwhich is the origin of and destination for three-quarters of Morocco\u2019s total trade \u2013 the agri-food sector\nhas grown 8.2% since 2013 (African Development Bank, n.d.). In the various policies implemented over recent years, the most important strategy by far for the agri-\nfood sector is the Green Morocco Plan for 2008 to 2020. The plan, launched in 2008, was designed\nto promote the development of 1.15 million jobs by 2020 and triple the income of nearly 3 million\npeople in rural areas19. The strategy was designed to support the development of agri-food by\nfostering closer links between producers and the processing industry (integration of upstream and\ndownstream processes) and fostering integration/cooperation as an organisational model (i.e. bringing together producers and farmers). According to the Ministry of Agriculture, integration/\ncooperation is the most appropriate solution to overcome the issue of small farms (70% of Moroccan\nfarmers own less than five hectares), and to tackle the challenges related to the lack of technical and\nmanagerial skills and of appropriate financial means for these farmers to modernise their production\n18 Source: Haut Commissariat au Plan, http://bds.hcp.ma/data/21.4 and http://bds.hcp.ma/data/21.1\n19 www.invest.gov.ma/?Id=25&lang=en&RefCat=5&Ref=148\nTHE FUTURE OF SKILLS \u2013 MOROCCO | 30"

In this way, bringing together the production and the commercialisation of agricultural\nproducts, farmers obtain the skills needed to optimise their production from partners in projects,\nresulting in the optimisation of the production process at all levels20. The Green Morocco Plan has produced positive results, though not as positive as originally planned. As an example, of the 1.15 million jobs to be created by 2020, only 342 000 additional job\nopportunities (less than a third) were created as of 2018. On the other hand, the plan stimulated\ninvestments in the agricultural sector (a total of MAD 104 billion between 2008 and 2018). On\nfostering cooperation among farmers (especially smallholders), the incentives system fostered by the\nstate supported 63 aggregation projects (in 2018) benefitting around 55 000 farmers, 80% of whom\nown less than five hectares or arable land21. Moreover, the plan has allowed the country to increase\nself-sufficiency to around 98% to 100% for meat, milk, fruits and vegetables, while it is 65% for\ncereals and 47% for sugar. As for the long-standing issue of water management, the plan has\nallowed the country to save 2 billion cubic metres of water by investing in more efficient irrigation\ntechniques. As a result, the surface area of crop fields with drip irrigation has almost quadrupled\nsince the plan was introduced22. The Ministry of Agriculture has also identified some challenges and shortcomings of the plan, such\nas the failed modernisation of slaughterhouses and not yet having a better structure for the food\ndistribution industry, which is believed to be of crucial importance to sustain and increase the\nefficiency of the Moroccan agri-food sector and enhance domestic demand. One of the main critiques\nof the Green Morocco Plan by commentators was the lack of coordination with other sectoral\ndevelopment strategies implemented over the same period of time, for instance the \u2018Emergence\u2019 plan\nfor industry."

Other critiques mention the \u2018standard\u2019 approach to agricultural development, relying on\nincreased investments and failing to thoroughly take into account the specific features of Moroccan\nagriculture, especially in rural areas, where the activity is mostly run by small family businesses that\nlack the capacity and resources to engage in bigger projects and attract larger investments (Akesbi,\n2011). The agri-food sector faces productivity challenges. The aggregation model fostered by the Green\nMorocco Plan, based on cooperatives, plays a central role in sectoral improvement, being an\ninnovative way to connect small- and large-scale producers, generating yields and ensuring\nagricultural production is in line with the requirements of the food industry (ibid.). It is not clear to\nwhat extent this has resulted in productivity improvements.

The PNEI23 focused on the important potential for economic\ngrowth for Moroccan agri-food, and aimed at exploiting this potential through a range of supporting\nmeasures such as a better development of agricultural resources and a diversified and competitive\noffer especially dedicated to exports. In order to do this, the PNEI focused on 8 to 10 value chains\nwith particularly high potential for exports, such as argan, olive oil, spices and processed vegetables\n20 Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Rural Development, Water and Forests:\nwww.agriculture.gov.ma/en/pages/strategy\n21 www.ada.gov.ma/en/main-achievements-green-morocco-plan\n22 www.agrimaroc.ma/plan-maroc-vert-realisations/\n23 www.amith.ma/portail/PDF/PACTE_Emergence_V2010.pdf\nTHE FUTURE OF SKILLS \u2013 MOROCCO | 31"

Another initiative impacting agribusiness is the Industrial Acceleration Plan (2014\u20132020)24. The plan\nwas a successful strategy launched to boost the Moroccan industrial sector and fully exploit its\npotential for economic and employment growth. The plan was very successful: the target of creating\n500 000 new jobs was reached or even exceeded in all targeted sectors in 2019, and overall\nindustrial exports increased between 2014 and 2019 by more than 39%. The agri-food sector made a\nstrong contribution to the plan\u2019s results: the sector contributed to the creation of more than 83 000\njobs between 2014 and 2019 and the sector\u2019s exports increased by more than 38%, which\ndemonstrates the great dynamic and growth potential of this industry. Finally, the Contract Programme 2017\u20132022 for agri-food is also a relevant policy for agribusiness25. It focuses on seven value chains considered the most important for sectoral development, due to\ntheir prominence and potential: citrus, fruits and vegetables; olive oil; dairy; meat; pastries and\nchocolate production; pasta; and couscous. The programme has specific targets to be reached by its\nconclusion and engages relevant stakeholders to achieve these targets. Relevant actors are not only\nthe responsible ministries, but also professional associations, to make sure the effort is truly\ncollective. Recent policy developments\nCooperatives are defined by Moroccan law as autonomous and voluntary associations to meet their\ncommon economic, social and cultural needs through a jointly owned and democratically controlled\nenterprise. The Green Morocco Plan favoured the creation of cooperatives around shared projects to\nimprove agriculture in specific regions, but also designated the state as facilitator in supporting\nexisting cooperatives, for instance by providing financial incentives and preferential access to credit\nto finance relevant projects and by fostering private investments in the agri-food sector26. As shown\nin Figure 3.7, cooperatives are more numerous in the subsectors of dairy, red meat, and honey\nproduction. Cooperatives are also numerous in the agricultural services subsector."

This\nnew strategy builds on the achievements of the Green Morocco Plan and further consolidates the\ngrowth for the sector and the subsequent social effects. The new strategy focuses particularly on human capital development, aiming at enhancing revenue\nof farmers through investments and wider access to social protection for workers in the agricultural\nsector. The strategy also aims to promote the sector among young people, to make working in\nagriculture as employees but especially as entrepreneurs more attractive to them. The strategy will\nmake arable land available by offering funding to 180 000 young entrepreneurs to launch start-ups28. The strategy aims to have 350 000 new workers and entrepreneurs not only in the agricultural sector\nbut also in all services related to it (i.e. other agri-food subsectors such as food processing, but also\nservices such as the provision of irrigation systems or pesticides/fertilisers). Finally, the strategy aims\nto support the creation of new agricultural organisations and cooperatives, with the aim of having five\ntimes more of such organisations by 2030, while also providing support to the implementation of\ndigitalisation and new technologies in all agricultural activities29. Employment\nAs previously mentioned, agri-food is a very important sector in Morocco. Output (value added) from\nthe agricultural sector accounts for around 12% of total output, while the food processing industry\nalone accounts for 25% of the total industrial GDP for Morocco (EU Delegation to Morocco, 2020). The value added from agriculture has remained relatively stable over time. But as Figure 3.8 reveals,\nagriculture is a major source of employment at around 40% of total employment (compared with the\n27 www.agrimaroc.ma/generation-green-agriculture-maroc/\n28 www.forbes.fr/environnement/generation-green-le-modele-agricole-marocain-un-exemple-a-suivre/\n29 www.ecoactu.ma/48788-2/\nTHE FUTURE OF SKILLS \u2013 MOROCCO | 33"

It is\nestimated that around 4 million rural inhabitants are employed in the agri-food industry. This estimate\nreveals that, particularly in rural areas, agriculture is largely dependent on a large workforce and\nrelies very little on techniques and technologies aimed at increasing productivity30. Additionally, one important factor to be taken into account is the extent of subsistence agriculture, i.e. when people are registered as self-employed and work in their own family field, producing food for\ntheir own use. This could particularly be the case for women, especially in rural areas. Recent data\nshows that around half of employed people are self-employed (48.6% in 2019), compared to only\n15.2% in the EU-27 in the same year31.

Investments have mainly targeted innovation in water\nmanagement and irrigation techniques as well as the differentiation of crops and the enhancement of\nself-sufficiency for agricultural production. Some attention has also been given to innovation on a\nsystemic level, in the way producers are interconnected among themselves and with the food\nprocessing industries. More recently, with the Green Morocco Plan and especially G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Green,\nincreasing importance has been given to human capital development and skills. In line with the integration/cooperation approach that has driven investments and innovation in the\nsector, Moroccan authorities have been developing agricultural production sites (agropoles) in some\nkey regions to strengthen upstream and downstream collaboration among relevant stakeholders and\nattract agri-food investments (as well as foreign investments). The regions of F\u00e8s-Mekn\u00e8s and\nBerkane, in northern Morocco, already have agropoles, supported by the public Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et de\ngestion that finances territorial development activities in the whole country. Four additional sites are\nplanned for the central regions of Tadla and El Haouz and for the coastal regions of Agadir and Gharb. Each agropole is designed to offer the following elements (Agency for Agricultural Development, 2015):\n\u25a0 an area of agro-industrial activities where food production companies are located;\n\u25a0 an area of logistics and service companies including business incubators;\n\u25a0 an area dedicated to distribution and trade activities;\n\u25a0 an element of research and development (R&D) (represented by the Institut national de la\nrecherche agronomique (INRA)), and food quality control authorities (represented by the Office\nnational de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sanitaire des produits alimentaires (ONSSA) and Morocco FOODEX);\n\u25a0 a dedicated training centre;\n\u25a0 an area dedicated to specific tertiary activities, such as banks, insurance companies, catering\nand other relevant services.

It is worth noting that IAV Hassan II\nno longer provides training at the level of technicians, but public and private universities are providing\ntechnician-level and bachelor\u2019s degrees. For VET, the Green Morocco Plan distinguishes between\nthree different providers with specific roles (ibid. ):\n\u25a0 agricultural vocational training, aimed at improving the technical and competitive aspects of\nbusinesses and farms by meeting their employees\u2019 skills needs, through training for adults\noffering qualifications for qualified and specialised technicians and workers;\n\u25a0 technical agricultural education, a dedicated path in lower secondary education (classes in\nagricultural technology) and upper secondary education (baccalaureate in agricultural sciences)\naiming to equip young students with the technical knowledge to pursue studies in agriculture,\nmaking the agricultural sector more attractive;\n\u25a0 apprenticeship training for the social and professional integration of rural youths, especially\ntargeted at young people living in rural areas who have dropped out of education with only\nprimary education or no qualifications.

On top of investments made in\nrecent years, more investments and policy developments in terms of employment and skills are part\nof G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Green, the new strategy to support the Moroccan agri-food sector. Nevertheless,\nimplementation of the strategy itself as well as the \u2018normal\u2019 development of the sector have been\nheavily impacted by the Covid-19 crisis, and the medium-term growth outcomes are still quite\nuncertain due to the current economic conditions and forecasts for the future, both at the national\nand global level. Commentators have noted that the efforts of the Moroccan government to increase agricultural self-\nsufficiency in the past two decades have been proved to be working. During spring 2020, when\nCovid-19 had its first impact in Morocco, the agricultural sector was able to provide the domestic\nmarket with an abundant supply of food while exports of fruits and vegetables grew 3% by mid-April\ncompared with the same period of 201935."

KEY DRIVERS OF CHANGE IN THE AGRI-\nFOOD SECTOR\nKEY ISSUES\n\u25a0 Analysis of the main drivers of change currently shaping the sector, such as global\nvalue chains, new technologies, digital tools and international regulations. The preceding chapter outlined the broad contours of skills demand in the agri-food sector. In moving\ntowards a more detailed analysis of skills needs \u2013 i.e. what are the actual skills people use in their\njobs and how are these skills likely to change? \u2013 there is a need to understand the factors driving the\nchange and those technologies that are associated with that change. It is not just about technological\nchange: a need to consider a variety of non-technological factors which will shape the future is\nrelevant as well. In the sections that follow, consideration is given to the range of technological and\nnon-technological factors driving change in the agri-food sector in Morocco. 4.1 Identifying drivers of demand\nFast technological development is one of the major factors influencing the demand for skills. There\nare many other factors such as social, economic and environmental ones which also determine and\nshape future skills needs. In order to study all the possible drivers of change, the entire Scopus and\nWeb of Science databases were searched to find scientific papers and conference proceedings\nrelated to the agri-food sector in Morocco. In addition, websites were scoured for direct information\nand links to various studies. The documents gathered were scanned using text mining tools to extract\nthe most relevant keywords which were then clustered using network analysis. Figure 4.1 provides a snapshot of such a clustering process: for example, the red group of connected\nterms clearly points to the semantic area of innovation along the supply chain. Browsing the network\nof correlations between the topics provides an understanding of the relationships among them. For\ninstance, the introduction of innovative solutions could lead to a reuse of agricultural waste, for the\nproduction, for example, of biomass energy, which then leads to a positive environmental impact and\nthe reduction of deforestation (red, yellow, blue and light-blue clusters respectively). Inspection of all\nclusters provides the basis for identifying potential candidates for drivers of change."

    "chunk_text": "Globalisation\nThe relevance of globalisation seen from the data mining analysis was confirmed in the interviews,\nwhich indicated it as a main driver of change, often affecting several subsequent factors. The increased competition that has arisen following globalisation has in some cases been a positive\nfactor for innovation and for finding other business solutions. In other cases, it has led to the\nabandonment of some business lines due to their uncompetitive price point compared to foreign\noperators (i.e. in the case of free trade agreements). The different starting conditions of companies within the sector have led to a series of possible\nscenarios. Many small-scale farmers seem to be focused on short-term issues while other\ncompanies focus on globalisation as they find the international market more profitable than the local\nmarket (e.g. companies that started as international exporters before being suppliers for the domestic\nmarket). Generally, the export of products is widespread among medium and large companies, both\nto North America and to Europe. If this is true for commercialisation aspects, the same can be said for issues related to technology,\nskills and competitiveness. Globalisation also implies a structured value and logistics chain and a\nhigh-quality standard. Since technologies often come from foreign companies, globalisation has\npositively affected the sector from the point of view of modernisation of storage, production\ntechniques, and environmental protection. Some of the conferences and fairs in which some\nMoroccan companies take part are also international. Attending postgraduate degrees abroad and\ndoing internships with European universities allow Moroccan students and workers to bring new\nskills, knowledge and innovation to the area. The opening of borders has certainly favoured an exchange of international collaboration and\nprojects (such as the Millennium Challenge Corporation). An open benchmark with producers from\nother countries has begun, usually unfavourably because of the higher Moroccan taxation and cost of\nenergy and smaller internal market. Very often imported goods are cheaper than locally produced\nones. Moreover, many new operators have entered the sector, in particular big farms. In such a\ncompetitive environment, people have started to look for alternative and advantageous solutions."

There is an effort from the government to cover\naround 80% of the expenses of the courses and it is asked to intervene, through ONSSA, to reduce\nthe informal market in favour of higher quality of the marketed products.

International regulations and standards\nAs much as national regulations and incentives affect companies\u2019 abilities to enter and operate in the\nmarket, international regulations and standards act as a main driver for international trade and\nexports, and can affect businesses in different directions. For example, strict regulations introduced\nin various countries on pesticide remnants and other pollutants in food obliged companies exporting\ntheir products to adopt more environmentally sustainable solutions. In general, regulations introduced\nin export-bound countries prompt companies in Morocco to focus on compliance to ensure they are\nstill able to export their products. Aridity and efficient water management\nIn 2018 and 2019, Morocco was hit by severe droughts and variability which affected water security\nand hence food and energy security. Such a factor affects crops, in particular those with the highest\nconsumption of water such as tomatoes. Other kinds of crops, such as olive tree cultivation,\nconsume less water and, in general, are more resistant to water scarcity. From a production point of\nview, aridity affects both the quality and quantity of crops. To cope with these environmental factors, local farmers have introduced some innovations: the\ndevelopment of new irrigation technologies that allow for more efficient use of water (drip irrigation);\nthe construction of wells to avoid drawing water directly from the main supply; and the introduction of\nnew varieties of plants that have higher resistance to water stress."

Numerous water policies and investments have been launched and developed over recent decades. Morocco has 145 large dams with a capacity exceeding 18.67 billion cubic metres and several\nthousand boreholes and wells to capture groundwater. The Green Morocco Plan and water-related\npolicies and programmes have helped to increase the irrigated area to 1.6 million hectares (in which\n610 000 hectares are equipped with drip irrigation systems). The programmes focused on efficiency\nand economy of water and energy by shifting from traditional irrigation schemes to drip irrigation\nsystems. In addition to IAV Hassan II, there are two other higher education schools that have the\nmandate to train engineers in water sectors: \u00c9cole Mohammadia des ing\u00e9nieurs in Rabat and \u00c9cole\nHassania des travaux publics in Casablanca. Energy efficiency is becoming increasingly important. Some companies are introducing improved\nenergy efficiency systems, and the use of alternative energy sources is often considered. In the\nfuture most companies will move towards alternative technologies, considering the current high cost\nof energy and the absence of traditional energy sources in the country. Photovoltaic solutions will\nlikely be adopted; unfortunately, up to now, they have not been accessible to many companies\nbecause of their price. Environmental sustainability and greening of the economy\nSome companies are starting to adopt alternative ways of producing energy in order to reduce the\nimpact of humans on the environment, both in terms of emissions and deforestation. The energy\nproduction from biomass obtained from olive waste is an example. In general, there is increased\nawareness of the need to reduce waste from the production processes. Reuse of waste materials\nthat are generated along the chain is increasingly widespread among companies. Due to the\nincreasing importance of exports to the sector, logistics is another area where improvements in\nresource use, efficiency and waste management will be needed. Organic farming, which is not yet widespread in Morocco, should contribute to the reduction of\nemissions, better soil and water quality, lower energy consumption and better energy efficiency.

This has led to the research of new varieties of crops that are more heat tolerant and\nresistant to water stress. Institutions such as INRA are working on the R&D of new varieties of plants\nand are supporting companies. In general, by adopting a new variety of cultivation, productivity\nincreases: it allows better water efficiency and produces more with less water. To reduce diseases,\nsome companies also use ecological techniques such as compost and essential oils. Technical innovation\nWhile technology has the potential to bring radical changes to the sector, from this first analysis of\ndata, the technological input does not seem to have achieved a breakthrough effect in the Moroccan\nagri-food sector yet.

In the period from 2005 to 2015, the\ninnovations introduced were mainly aimed at coping with the climatic situation due to droughts and\nclimate change, such as more effective irrigation systems and new plant varieties.

Changes in consumer tastes\nCompanies often pointed out that changing consumer tastes led to the development of new\nconsumption patterns and therefore a reshaping of business. Until recently, some types of food\nproducts were made at home (subsistence economy), and the most widely marketed products were\nfresh ones. According to the interviews, due to the development of urbanisation, women entering the\nlabour market and more recently Covid-19, the demand for processed products has increased. Fresh\nproducts are experiencing a slowdown in consumption in favour of long-life products. This leads\ncompanies to want to satisfy the new needs of customers by offering products that are aligned with\ntheir preferences. Some sectors such as pastry and gastronomy have developed recently so there is\na strong demand for new competences.

    "chunk_text": "On the potential impact of technologies\nThe interviews with key stakeholders and companies confirmed the relevance of all the technologies\npresented in the previous section. The discussions also highlighted which technologies are more\nlikely to come on stream in the foreseeable future and transform elements of the agri-food sector. Even though there is awareness that the introduction of new technologies can improve\ncompetitiveness and productivity at all stages of the value chain (e.g. yield, durability, system\nirrigation, fertilisation processes and soil conservation), these technologies, except in large\nenterprises, have rarely been adopted to date. The sector is moving at two different speeds: the first group of farms (the minority) is modern and\nevolving by adopting digital and mechanical technologies, sometimes imported from other countries;\nthe second group (the majority) is composed of farms that are smaller in dimension, still work with\ntraditional methods, and are facing multiple challenges with respect to new technologies. As a result,\nand despite incentives from the government, precision agriculture solutions or even drip irrigation\nsystems are not common. The high cost of the technologies means they are out of reach of many\nplayers in the sector, but it is also the case that some in the sector are wedded to more traditional\nsystems of production. To support the transition, cooperatives and institutions like ONCA are the bridge between INRA and\nsmall farmers and are responsible for transferring technologies and competences. While INRA\ncarries out research, ONCA directly interacts with farmers. Also thanks to this support, those value\nchains that have started to invest in processing have reached high levels of technological\ndevelopment. New technologies can bring enhancements at all stages of the value chain, from production in the\nfield to market distribution. Many of the new technologies and approaches most commonly\nmentioned in the interviews have the potential to change the sector if adopted. The key ones are\nlisted below. \u25a0 Introduce drip irrigation and sensor-based irrigation to counter water scarcity and improve\nproduction. Parts of the country are not irrigated and reaching remote regions even with\nstandard irrigation techniques will have a profound impact on production and job creation."

The complex interplay of factors shaping the sector calls for long-term\nstrategies. \u25a0 Numerous technologies are coming on stream which are likely to transform the agri-food sector. Many technologies show a positive adoption trend with implications for related jobs profiles. \u25a0 According to interviewees, certain technologies have the potential to completely disrupt and\nreshape production and value chains. Economic support and changes in the mindsets of\nproducers are needed to boost wider adoption, especially in smaller enterprises. \u25a0 The following factors all have the potential to create new jobs in the sector: growing trend of\ninnovation, increasing quality of production, the creation of niche products or markets with higher\nvalue added, the greening of production, and the high volumes of exports.

ONGOING CHANGES IN JOBS AND SKILLS\nDEMAND\nKEY ISSUES\n\u25a0 An analysis of the main occupational profiles used in the sector and of the evolution of\nthe skill content of selected occupations as a result of the changes occurring in the\nsector. \u25a0 An analysis of new tasks and functions which have emerged in the jobs and/or\noccupations in this sector, as well as of the ones that have disappeared (or are likely to\ndisappear). \u25a0 The impact of the drivers of change on labour and skills demand in the sector, and\nwhether such changes require higher levels of the same skills or completely new sets\nof skills. While the previous chapter looked at the drivers of change in the agri-food sector and the associated\ntechnological changes, this chapter focuses on the implications of these changes. From both the\ndata mining and the interviews, two groups of occupations emerged as likely to be increasingly\nsought in relation to the technological changes being introduced into agri-food: (i) technical or\ntechnology-related occupations (see Section 5.1); and (ii) business services and related occupations\n(see Section 5.2). Section 5.3 describes new skills needs. In addition, attention is given to those jobs\nwhich may become obsolescent. Overall, the analysis reveals that significant changes are taking\nplace, and will continue to take place, in job profiles resulting from the technological changes\ndescribed in the previous chapter. 5.1 Technology-related occupations\nIdentifying emerging jobs and skills needs\nThe incumbents of technology-related occupations comprise those who manage and use a given\ntechnology. The key assumption is that the growing interest in a certain technology (as expressed by\npatents filed, discussion in scientific papers, and so on) is associated with a growing need for skills\nassociated with the use of that technology. The scale of skills demand will depend on the adoption or\ndiffusion of the technology, which may vary for a number of reasons (e.g. capital constraints), and the\nstrategic decisions companies make regarding the organisation of work. There are various possible ways to link the information on technologies derived from text mining to\nthe possible future skills needs. The following procedure was used."

In many cases, it lists general skills (e.g. test sensors), while\nspecific competences (e.g. knowledge of different types of sensor devices), which effectively allow\ndeeper detail, are less well covered. Additionally, the competence level required (e.g. how much\nknowledge/ability in a sensor device is required for each of the various occupations it appears in) is\nanother critical factor which is not specified in existing classification systems such as ESCO. In\naddition to this, the technologies likely to be increasingly adopted in agri-food may result in demand\nfor people to work in jobs or occupations which are new and not classified in ESCO, ISCO or other\njob classifications. To address the limitation described above and obtain a more complete picture of the knowledge\nneeded to master a given technology, additional information was obtained from Wikipedia (chosen\nfor its accessibility, the comprehensive amount of information it contains, and the structured way it\npresents information). More precisely, for every topic (most recurrent terms found in patents) the\ncorresponding Wikipedia page was downloaded using web scraping. The content of the pages and of\nits associated content tree was then semantically matched with the various related occupations in\norder to find those technical concepts that seemed to correlate with each one of them. It is thus\npossible to provide a more in-depth analysis of the specific skills that will be required in various\ntechnical jobs (as shown in Table 5.3).

The\nranking is indicative of which job profiles are of potential interest but not for the exact order or score. A full-scale analysis of the demand for jobs would require a deeper investigation and a range of\ndifferent approaches, and is beyond the scope of the present study.

Figure 5.3 shows the distribution of competences across occupations. For example, it reveals that to\nwork in the agri-food sector, the electrical engineer needs to have skills related to sensors, digital\ncamera sensors and microsensors, robotics, instrumentation equipment, electric drivers and\ncomputer technology. On the other hand, the mechanical engineer needs to have competences that\nare mostly linked to the use of thermal and hydraulic systems. It is also interesting to note that the agronomist, according to ESCO at least, seems to be a\nprofession with a rather small set of competences. However, the increasing relevance of techniques\nsuch as precision agriculture for agronomic production hints at the fact that ESCO classification is not\nsufficient to define the skills range of future agronomists: it is very likely (and trends in other countries\nTHE FUTURE OF SKILLS \u2013 MOROCCO | 62"

Such\nprofessions, which are related to particular agri-food subsectors rather than technologies, are\nrelevant to the business models that companies adopt and the way they organise production. These\nprofessions affect the adoption and use of technology in agriculture. The same data mining analysis used to identify technology-related jobs was used to identify the\nfollowing business service occupations (from both ESCO and O*NET):\n\u25a0 renewable energy consultant, \u25a0 horticulture production team leader,\n\u25a0 renewable energy sales representative, \u25a0 fruit production team leader,\n\u25a0 agronomic crop production team leader, \u25a0 horticulture production manager.

The list spans from business professionals and associated professionals (ISCO\nGroup 24 \u2013 business and administration professionals and ISCO Group 33 \u2013 business and\nadministration associate professionals) to highly skilled profiles and team leaders (ISCO Group 61 \u2013\nmarket-oriented skilled agricultural workers, limited to organisational and planning roles) to medium-\nskilled ones.

A clear example is given by commercial roles. Many interviewees pointed out that there is a general\nneed for experts in communication, marketing and negotiations in order to promote national products\nin the global market. Nowadays, this implies more expertise in digital techniques, such as for social\nmedia marketing and e-commerce, and thus new profiles for such occupations will emerge in the\ncountry. Some value chains are already trying to digitalise their marketing and creating a unique\ndigital platform for the business-to-consumer market. It is important to fill this competences gap: the\ndigital divide may hamper the success of many small companies, which may not be able to take full\nadvantage of the new opportunities and the incentives and tools provided by institutions and\nassociations. In a similar way, the need to improve quality standards and introduce more sophisticated quality\ncontrols often requires the employment of dedicated professionals, such as quality engineers;\nregardless of this, existing production engineers and technicians need to learn about metrology\ntechniques, food management, quality control management and safety issues. Farmers will have to\nlearn how to grow and test their products to ensure quality and health standards. Finally, some large enterprises have introduced digitalisation and mechanisation in their processes. In these cases, they have started to look for new competences: new kinds of roles have been\ncreated, such as qualified technicians that have some specialisation in automation and sensors. Other professions are instead totally new, at least for Morocco. For example, the increasing demand\nfor processed foods creates new subsectors, such as pastry, gastronomy and cheese, which in turn\ncreate a demand for new competences and job roles."

Even if the introduction\nof automation in their field of activity takes place, manual activities will continue to be necessary. It\nmay be that some specific activities related to elementary professions (such as farmworkers and\nlabourers) will disappear, but employers reported that people will be relocated to different activities\nand will not be replaced; this is in line with the data shown in Figure 5.4. So far, the limited digitalisation in the sector has not affected manual work and has not replaced\npeople with automation; it has mainly positively affected some technical aspects that concern\nmeasurements and in some cases data acquisition. At the same time, the introduction of\ntechnologies helps improve working conditions: at the field level, many activities are still tiring, heavy,\nand energy-consuming for manual operators, and technological solutions will reduce effort and\nthereby safeguard the workers\u2019 health.

MEETING THE CHANGES IN SKILLS\nDEMAND\nKEY ISSUES\n\u25a0 How the changes due to the introduction of new technologies affect skills utilisation\nand working conditions in the sector. \u25a0 How businesses meet their new skills needs (e.g. via recruitment or retraining existing\nworkers), and the relationships they have with education and training providers. \u25a0 Whether the education and training system is adapting sufficiently to changing skills\nneeds resulting from technological and other changes to meet the agri-food\u2019s skills\nneeds in Morocco. This chapter focuses on company strategies to meet their emerging skills needs. Please note that all\nfindings presented in this chapter are from the focus group discussion and the in-depth interviews\nconducted with companies and key stakeholders (from both education and employment sides). 6.1 Constraints on technological change\nCompanies were asked which factors have limited the adoption of new technologies and the\ndevelopment of their business. Answers were divided into two main groups: economic aspects and\nthe supply of skills. For many interviewees, the main limiting factor is the high cost of new technologies and the related\ninsufficient investments to support technology adoption. Modern irrigation techniques, photovoltaic\nsolutions, greenhouses, solar dryers and precision agriculture are all technologies that many farmers\nwould like to introduce but lack the funds to do so. This varies to some degree according to their\nposition in the value chain. Employers are different from one another in their capacity to invest, with\nlarge companies being much better placed to introduce innovations than smaller ones. A related aspect is the role of incentives to promote the introduction of new technologies. Government agencies have promoted the development of the agri-food sector. It was reported that\nthere is a division of competences between the Ministry of Agriculture (concerned with upstream\nactivities) and the Ministry of Industry (with downstream processes). Improved integration would be\nbeneficial. For agri-food companies, there are two funds which they can draw on to assist with their\ndevelopment: a fund for industrial development and a fund for agricultural development. Both provide\nopportunities, but for small-scale farmers it is practically difficult to obtain access to them."

    "chunk_text": "competitive while at the same time the price for raw materials has increased. Regarding competition\nfrom the informal market, the agricultural sector is defiscalised, while the agri-food sector, i.e. more\nstructured companies, pays taxes and value added tax (20%). Traditional producers on the informal\nmarket that do not offer quality standards can keep prices much lower than their formal counterparts. Furthermore, the high price of quality certifications discourages the creation of structured, controlled\nand well-organised value chains. A further factor affecting the competitiveness of the sector is its capacity to pay the wages to attract\nthe skills it needs. Graduate engineers, for instance, can easily find a job in Morocco but many of\nthem (about 25% of the total) decide to go abroad for work because the salaries are higher. And if\nskilled people choose not to move abroad, they prefer to work in the public sector. Moreover, young\nengineering graduates also prefer to work and live in the cities. In the rural areas where much of the\nagri-food sector is located, and where there is much growth because of the Green Morocco Plan, it is\nbecoming difficult to find enough qualified engineers. A second line of thought identifies the lack of competences and the shortage of qualified workers as\na factor hindering the diffusion of innovation and the development of the sector. Employers reported\nthat many competences discussed in the previous chapter are in short supply. Indeed, apart from\nmigration and salary issues, there is the issue of capacity of the education and training system: for\nexample, IAV Hassan II is only able to train a limited number of engineers each year, as they do not\nhave capacity and teachers to do more, while an existing VET track was cancelled due to lack of\nresources. In general, even if there is a lack of higher education graduates, most of the problem is\nlinked to VET graduates, due to the limited capacity of the education systems, but also to very limited\nuse of laboratories and practical activities to provide the right set of skills needed by companies."

R&D\ncapability has also been reported as a key missing aspect by various interviewees. The gap in competences has negative consequences: farmers are unable to take advantage of the\nmany incentives provided by institutions and associations. For example, Fenagri developed a free-of-\ncharge digital platform for e-commerce, but some cooperatives were not able to access it because of\nthe low level of digital skills in their workforces. It is also a matter of mindset. Because many agri-food enterprises are small (essentially\nsmallholdings), the approach to business is a traditional one which is not oriented or open to\ninnovation. It is focused on meeting short-term goals with little interest in the global market (or how\nthe global market might eventually affect the demand for what they produce). According to some\ninterviewees, even when competences are widely available and access to technology is subsidised,\nchange still fails to take place. For example, some farmers will not accept the introduction of new\nvarieties of plants because it goes against what they have been doing for years. Courses for\nenhancing and updating many competences are available and the government covers around 80% of\ntheir costs, but available technicians with diplomas in digital skills still face difficulties finding\nemployment. According to some interviews, it is not so much the lack of an innovation-oriented mindset that is the\nproblem, but the organisation of the value chain. At present there is no clear guidance on how to\nraise quality and productivity. This is required to lead small-scale farmers to use technologies that\nare developed by INRA or other institutes. Small-scale farmers should be better organised. Larger\ncompanies and cooperatives could contribute here. For example, with guidance linked to funding, the\nsector would be better incentivised to take up organic farming, renewable energy, climate-smart\nagriculture and environmentally friendly technologies."

Non-technical but systemic innovation\nthat the sector needs includes wider application of new technologies, training at all skills levels,\naggregation to increase productivity of smaller farms, and improved role of sectoral associations to\nsupport small producers. In particular, this calls for special support for cooperatives to widen their\ndistribution. Another factor that has emerged from the interviews is the lack of awareness of the Moroccan\npopulation about healthy eating and environmental sustainability (despite a growing consciousness in\nspecific groups). The other side of the coin is that organic food costs more and is less affordable than\nconventional foodstuffs. 6.2 Finding the required skills \u2013 recruitment\nRecruitment strategies vary according to the level of the profile that is required and it seems that\nthere is no single strategy. Some businesses rely exclusively on head-hunters, while others (usually\nsmall-scale farmers) mainly adopt word-of-mouth solutions. Other companies prefer to hire people\nwho work for competitors so that no training is needed as skills have already been acquired. This\n\u2018poaching externality\u2019, as it is sometimes referred to, is a disincentive for employers to train people. In\ngeneral, for recruitment, companies use advertisements and some employment agencies (Anapec). The availability of skills varies by geographical area. In some regions there is an excess supply of\nskills, while the opposite is true in more remote regions. In general, there are four major issues when\nrecruiting people with the skills required: (i) the relatively low attractiveness of the sector compared\nwith positions in the public sector; (ii) many highly skilled workers (including engineers) leave the\ncountry to work abroad; (iii) in some regions, it is difficult to reach the enterprises and there is a\ngeneral preference to live and work in cities; and (iv) there is a varying level of supply coming from\nthe local education and training system. Among larger enterprises, internship programmes are commonly used."

Training programmes\nare usually project-oriented and INRA and ONCA collaborate in developing programmes together. GIAC helps companies define strategies for skills and competences development, while INRA\nprovides consultancy regarding quality issues. The government covers around 80% of the expenses\nof the courses and there are several establishments which provide professional training.

However, companies point out that the\ncurricula are sometimes too theoretical, such that new graduates have good theoretical knowledge\nbut less developed practical competences. To address the skills gap, companies use a mix of strategies. Specific training can be carried out\ninternally in the company while continuing learning programmes are usually provided through\ngovernment support (mainly through arranged agreement with the OFPPT). In the last five years\n(2015-2020), the demand from companies for continuing training has doubled, and it is increasing\nevery year. On the basis of annual training plans, the first set of training is usually carried out by\ninternal experts; for the second set, companies usually have agreements with the OFPPT so the\ntraining is subsidised by the state. In a few cases, companies have set up internal training academies\nthat provide apprenticeship programmes coupling practical experience with theory. There are also\nsome events (such as the Cit\u00e9 des m\u00e9tiers in Agadir) or training programmes provided by ONCA (for\nagriculture) and ONSSA (for industry). Some companies have internship programmes with\nuniversities abroad (e.g. France and Spain), while others have internship programmes with schools\nin Morocco; every year, some technicians are sent to engineering schools in Morocco for specific\ntraining. In any case, the need for training is widely acknowledged in the sector, especially for new graduates. The common perception is that knowledge of the needs of the market, the processes and the\ncompetitors has to be learned in the field.

    "chunk_text": "6.4 A final word on the findings\nVarious good practices are being implemented in the country. The introduction of coordinated\nstrategies, such as the Green Morocco Plan, has helped Morocco reduce productivity gaps with other\ncountries. The creation of multidisciplinary agropoles, where the main institutions of the sectors are\nclustered, has contributed to reducing the problem of access to international research and markets. The new strategic plan (G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Green) is expected to bring even more advances to the sector. The aggregation of smaller players promoted by the Green Morocco Plan has resulted in positive\nimpacts on both productivity and revenues. However, agri-food in Morocco is still structured in two segments that seem to proceed at two\ndifferent speeds: on one side a minor set of companies, mainly large ones, that produce using\nmodern techniques, and on the other side, the majority of small farmers still produce using traditional\nmeans. There is also great heterogeneity, with many subsectors (some important economically,\nothers important from a social point of view, for instance argan production). The vision of\nstakeholders is that all groups and sectors need to be supported. A first important aspect is related to the transfer of technologies to farmers. The adoption of solutions\nsuch as precision agriculture, modern irrigation techniques and renewable energy is definitely one of\nthe main drivers of development for the sector. Several incentives are available for investing in new\ntechnologies, but their limited diffusion hints at the fact that many farmers are still not able to access\nsuch incentives; moreover, in many cases the attitude towards innovation should change. Farmers\nshould be helped to raise their skills level so that they can really take advantage of new technologies. An increased technological input would also increase the attractiveness of the sector (especially for\nyounger generations) and support new start-ups (as suggested in G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Green). A way to achieve the transfer of new technologies to farms of all sizes could be through the\naggregation model, or with cooperatives, and through the mediation of sectoral associations and\npublic institutions."

In particular ONCA can play a relevant role, connecting with farmers and training\nthem on the use of new technologies. Important here will be demonstrating the benefits of investing\nin new technologies such as clearly signalling the economic benefits which can be gained from, for\nexample, using solar power to dry food. In other words, it is about persuading producers to be more\nopen to innovations of one kind or another, given that the failure to change may ultimately threaten\nthe viability of their current businesses. The aggregation of small farmers has been one of the key elements of the Green Morocco Plan, and\nitself is an innovation. This direction should be pursued even further to promote different types of\ncollective organisations. For example, the economic interest group (groupement d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat\n\u00e9conomique) can play a substantial role in regional development, as they put together traditional\nunits that otherwise would not be able to ensure quality; however, they should be provided with more\ncapacity in terms of number of experts, and with incentives to compensate for higher costs than in\nthe informal market. Another important direction of action relates to planning according to value chains. One of the main\nchallenges for the future is to enhance and diversify local products at the same time as improving the\nquality of production in order to attract even more customers, at national and international levels. More structured value chains and a better link between industry and related services and professions\nwill increase employment both in the agricultural sector proper and in all the other economic sectors\nthat interact with it: industry, energy, craft, design and marketing. In this sense, the agri-food sector\ncan be an important job creator since it requires different kinds of job roles, and a lot of opportunities\nTHE FUTURE OF SKILLS \u2013 MOROCCO | 75"

For value chains that are not organised yet, there\nis a need to tackle the issues behind the lack of organisation in order to create new employment. Also, the shift towards market niches and higher value added crops or applications has the potential\nto create additional jobs but needs to be supported with adequate measures and training. It is not\nonly technical skills that need to be acquired or developed, but also skills in quality management,\nmanagerial capability and business activities. Support is also needed in terms of incentives to boost\ncooperation and to develop bankable business plans. Another area that could bring improvement to the sector is that of certification. Currently a quality\ncertification is issued by ONSSA and it is expected that all companies will have it by the end of 2021. However, some constraints need to be removed. Presently, production is very heterogeneous in\nterms of quality; moreover, consumers still look at the price more than the quality of the products,\nand thus the informal market is a great obstacle for the development of the agri-food sector. An\nawareness campaign on the healthier aspects of quality products would support the sector. Consumers should be encouraged to buy quality products and avoid uncertified food. Moreover, despite the general public largely being unaware of health and security concerns related\nto food and food production, it is worth underlining that due to Covid-19, customers have become\nand are becoming more aware of the health aspects related to food consumption. The change in\nawareness of consumers means quality certifications, new technologies, and organic farming are\nexpected to grow even more. For organic farming, the sector needs to develop more competences in\nview of its likely future growth. ONCA is responsible for transferring technologies and competences\nand with the local associations must manage the transition and skills requirements."

The Ministry of Agriculture could revise education programmes to adapt to these emerging\nniches, together with the OFPPT and the VET department of the Ministry of Education, in relation to\napprenticeships and private schools. In the above-mentioned aspects too, the sector is moving at two different speeds: some farms are\nevolving by adopting digital and mechanical technologies, and producing organic products, while\nsome other farms are smaller and still work with traditional methods. The latter have no ability to\nobtain a quality certification without the support of engineers or technicians. In this sense, bigger\nindustries and cooperatives should help small companies in training and technology development. G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Green also focuses on the creation of communities inside rural areas. Future investments\ncould make the sector more attractive for young people, create a community of smart young farmers\nthat will boost the adoption of new technologies, and help the sector move towards more efficient and\nproductive solutions. According to the interviews, in part this is already happening in some areas of\nthe country. It is hoped that these findings will raise awareness of policy-makers and practitioners about the\nchanging skills needs in the agri-food sector and provide food for thought especially in relation to the\nability of the education and training system to address these changes and to prepare workers to be fit\nfor the new jobs and occupations.

For smaller enterprises, word of mouth is also a solution. \u25a0 The subsectors do have links with the education and training system, but employers report that\nschools are not able to provide all the competences required by the industry. \u25a0 Companies try to compensate for skills gaps in their workforces by widening their training\nstrategies, e.g. by providing in-house learning, mentoring and on-the-job training, or using\nexternal organisations to secure training, or even setting up their own internal academies and\ntraining centres. \u25a0 Private actors in the sector pointed out that to allow the entire sector to grow, more specific\nprofessional schools (from the value chain of oil to that of milk production) are needed. In\nparallel, the enhancement of continuing training and reskilling and upskilling is essential to\nensure sector-specific skills and make workers adaptable to new emerging needs.

Cognitive bias is a systematic pattern of deviation from the norm or rationality in judgement. Cognitive biases are considered by many authors as linked to the normal functioning of the human\nbrain and thus can arise in any activity involving human judgement. Competence means \u2018the proven ability to use knowledge, skills and personal, social and/or\nmethodological abilities, in work or study situations and in professional and personal development\u2019\n(European Qualifications Framework). While sometimes used as synonyms, the terms skill and\ncompetence can be distinguished according to their scope. The term skill refers typically to the use of\nmethods or instruments in a particular setting and in relation to defined tasks. The term competence\nis broader and refers typically to the ability of a person \u2013 facing new situations and unforeseen\nchallenges \u2013 to use and apply knowledge and skills in an independent and self-directed way. Cross-sector knowledge, skills or competences is one of the four levels of skills reusability\nidentified by the ESCO initiative, whereby reusability means how widely a knowledge, skills or\ncompetence concept can be applied in different working contexts. Cross-sector knowledge is\nrelevant to occupations across several economic sectors, whereas sector-specific or occupation-\nspecific knowledge is restricted to one specific sector or occupation. See also transversal\nknowledge. Cross-sector technology \u2013 adopting the cross-sector concept from ESCO\u2019s skills reusability\nlevels, the term indicates a technology that finds application in many different economic sectors (e.g. control units or sensors). ESCO is the multilingual classification of European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and\nOccupations. ESCO works as a dictionary, describing, identifying and classifying professional\noccupations, skills and qualifications relevant for the EU labour market and education and training,\nin a format that can be understood by electronic systems."

    "chunk_text": "Job title is the identifying label given by the employer to a specific job, usually when looking for new\ncandidates to the position. In the absence of standardised nomenclature, it can coincide with either a\ndescription of the job or the occupation group the job belongs to. NACE (Nomenclature statistique des activit\u00e9s \u00e9conomiques dans la Communaut\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne\n[Statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community]) is a four-digit\nclassification providing the framework for collecting and presenting a large range of statistical data\naccording to economic activity in the fields of economic statistics, provided by Eurostat. Economic\nactivities are divided into 10 or 11 categories at high-level aggregation, while they are divided into\n38 categories at intermediate aggregation. Natural language processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of linguistics,\ncomputer science and information engineering. NLP deals with the interactions between computers\nand human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyse\nlarge amounts of natural language data, starting from the identification of the grammatical and logical\nparts of speech within a sentence, up to the complex representation of semantic relationships\nbetween words. O*NET stands for Occupational Information Network, a free online database of occupational\nrequirements and worker attributes. At the time of writing, the online database contains 1 016\noccupational titles, each with standardised and occupation-specific descriptors, covering the entire\nUS economy. It describes occupations in terms of the skills and knowledge required, how the work is\nperformed, and typical work settings. It can be used by businesses, educators, jobseekers and\nhuman resources professionals. It is a program to facilitate the development and maintenance of a\nskilled workforce, developed under the sponsorship of the US Department of Labour/Employment\nand Training Administration (USDOL/ETA). For more info, see www.onetcenter.org/ and\nwww.onetonline.org/. Occupation \u2013 according to ESCO, an occupation is \u2018a grouping of jobs involving similar tasks, and\nwhich require a similar skill set\u2019. Occupations should not be confused with jobs or job titles."

    "chunk_text": "Occupations should not be confused with jobs or job titles. While a\njob is bound to a specific work context and executed by one person, occupations group jobs by\ncommon characteristics (for example, being the \u2018project manager for the development of the\nventilation system of the Superfly 900 aircraft\u2019 is a job; \u2018project manager\u2019, \u2018aircraft engine specialist\u2019 or\n\u2018heating, ventilation, air conditioning engineer\u2019 could be occupations, i.e. groups of jobs, to which this\njob belongs). Occupational profile is an explanation of the occupation in the form of description, scope,\ndefinition, and list of the knowledge, skills and competences considered relevant for it. Each\noccupation in the ESCO database also comes with an occupational profile that further distinguishes\nbetween essential and optional knowledge, skills and competences. Profession \u2013 an occupation requiring a set of specific skills and dedicated training. Qualification is the \u2018formal outcome of an assessment and validation process which is obtained\nwhen a competent body determines that an individual has achieved learning outcomes to given\nstandards\u2019 (European Qualifications Framework). Regulated profession \u2013 a profession is called regulated if its access, scope of practice, or title is\nregulated by law. THE FUTURE OF SKILLS \u2013 MOROCCO | 82"

    "chunk_text": "Semantic matching is a technique used in computer science to identify information which is\nsemantically related. Skill means \u2018the ability to apply knowledge and use know-how to complete tasks and solve problems\u2019\n(European Qualifications Framework). Skills can be described as cognitive (involving the use of\nlogical, intuitive and creative thinking) or practical (involving manual dexterity and the use of\nmethods, materials, tools and instruments). While sometimes used as synonyms, the terms skill and\ncompetence can be distinguished according to their scope. See competence for more details. Soft skills are usually associated with transversal skills and are considered the cornerstone for\npersonal development, also within the context of labour and employment. To distinguish them from\nother knowledge-based basic skills, they are often referred to as social or emotional skills. They can\nbe further classified into personal skills (e.g. problem-solving and adaptability) or interpersonal ones\n(e.g. teamwork and leadership). Text mining is a general term indicating a variety of techniques that allow computers to extract,\ndiscover or organise relevant information from large collections of different written resources, such as\nwebsites, books and articles. The first part of any text mining process implies the transformation of\ntexts in structured representations useful for subsequent analysis through the use of NLP tools. Sometimes AI techniques are used to perform text mining tasks more effectively. Transversal knowledge, skills or competences is the highest of the four levels of skills reusability\nidentified by the ESCO initiative. Transversal skills are relevant to a broad range of occupations and\nsectors. They are often referred to as core skills, basic skills or soft skills, the cornerstone for the\npersonal development of a person. Transversal knowledge, skills and competences are the building\nblocks for the development of the \u2018hard\u2019 skills and competences required to succeed in the labour\nmarket. Transversal technology, adopting the transversal concept from ESCO\u2019s skills reusability levels, is\nrelevant to a broad range of occupations and sectors and is a building block for more specific\ntechnologies (e.g. computerised image analysis).
