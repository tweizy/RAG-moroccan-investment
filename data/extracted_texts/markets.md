RECOMMENDATIONS
Improving Market Contestability
Improve the contestability of markets to support the entry and growth of a competitive and dynamic private sector
1. Review the competitive neutrality of SOE commercial activities by implementing subsidiarity analyses
and clarifying the scope of SOE activities. Apply the same set of rules and provide the same incentives
to SOEs’ commercial activities as those offered to private firms (for example, procurement, access to
land, access to finance).
2. Transfer to the purview of the Competition Council the authority to approve mergers and acquisitions.
3. Harmonize public incentives (such as taxes, subsidies, training) across all exporters, irrespective of
location.
4. Increase the incentives to release land for productive investment and level the playing field among
private players and with SOEs (for example, increase taxation on unused land; improve access to
information on land availability).
5. Reduce import tariffs on consumer goods to reduce protection in the domestic market and incentivize
investment towards export-oriented industries and away from non-tradable sectors.
Entrepreneurship and SME development
Increase access by new and young firms and SMEs to essential services in order to build robust ecosystems in support
of productivity, innovation and job creation
1. Scale-up activities that foster an entrepreneurial mindset such as mentoring, networking, business
competitions; further support and expand the provision of incubation, acceleration and business
development services for starts-ups.
2. Expand programs to acquire entrepreneurial skills at all levels of education and mobilize existing talent
such as the Moroccans living abroad.
3. Improve financial access to and viability of starts-ups and existing SMEs by providing financing to along
the life-cycle of start-up projects; adopting the crowdfunding law; implementing guarantee instruments
to inject long term financing for SMEs; and providing credit insurance to SMEs to mitigate the impact of
B2B payment delays.
4. Implementing the government’s digital strategy, Maroc Digital 2020, and programs (including e-payment
and digital platforms); strengthening the Agence de Developpement du Digital. Foster the digital
economy by increasing access to existing broadband infrastructure (via the sharing of infrastructure
between telecom companies) supported by implementing regulation and ensuring greater regulatory
clarity and transparency.
5. Implement the government’s public procurement decree at all levels of government (central, local and
SOEs).

Infrastructure
Encourage more participation of the private sector in infrastructure in support of greater investment efficiency and
impact, innovative technology and capabilities, and to buttress fiscal sustainability
1. Encourage the origination of projects suitable for private sector investment including by strengthening the
capacity of the civil servants in the responsible entities.
2. Identify viable infrastructure services to outsource to the private sector.
3. Establish clear guidelines for granting guarantees to SOEs and encourage SOEs to finance investment on
a commercial basis; augment public sector’s capacity to monitor and evaluate the PPP portfolio.
4. Improve transparency of sector regulations and eliminate overlap between PPP law and sector specific
laws.
5. Improve availability and transparency of financial and performance information in sectors where private
investment is needed.
Deep Dives for private sector opportunities
1. Cross-cutting: Private investments in all sectors would benefit from the measures highlighted above, in
particular those that improve the contestability of markets.
2. Tertiary education: Increase enrollment in private universities to absorb a higher number of high school
graduates and improve the quality of tertiary education by ensuring the new regulation on
state recognition does not protect incumbents; improving affordability of private tertiary
education including through lower fees when the state is involved, scholarships and
student loans.
3. Vocational training: Foster private vocational training by replicating the successful PPPs (IDGs); channeling
resources toward on-the-job training.
4. Automotive sector: Proactively support domestic investment and local SMEs expansion into the automotive
sector by mapping high-potential firms in the sector and beyond, including in particular
suppliers in in metal stamping and in the interiors and seating clusters; facilitate joint-
ventures; and provide financial and technical support to potential candidates.
5. Aerospace sector: Attract more foreign investors by scaling up training and skills upgrading, expanding
clusters and maintenance and repair activities; providing more structured support to
firms on the acquisition of industry standards; improve access to affordable land in
appropriate locations.

Note: the methodology uses various indicators to identify the products including Proximity (how close two goods are in the global
product space); Feasibility (the ease of market entry to produce a product); Fitness of Countries (country’s industrialization level and
future prospects of growth); Attractiveness of Goods (measures the capabilities needed to produce a product); and Revealed Comparative
Advantage (RCA).The approach is based on the concept of “hidden capabilities”—A country’s productive structure shines a light on the
capabilities it possesses and which new opportunities can be reached.

those in the MENA region and beyond suggests that prices are indeed significantly higher in Morocco.
• The empirical findings point to average prices being about 17 percent higher in Morocco than in a set
of comparators that includes countries in the MENA region, the OECD and some other peer countries
(MENA ++), even after controlling for potential demand and cost factors that can impact prices such as
income per capita, cost of import and tariff rates (see column 1 in the table below).
• When prices are compared among major cities, the results suggest an even higher price differential:
residents of Casablanca pay about 50 percent more, on average, for bottled water than residents of
similar cities in the MENA region and beyond (see column 2 and 3 in the table).

BOX 2 Two success stories in the automotive industry
Tuyauto is a family-owned SME that has been operating in the automotive sector in Casablanca since
1960, initially specializing in the manufacture of exhaust pipes for the domestic market, including spare
parts. It has managed to successfully diversify its production by branching out into aluminum stamping
for automobile exports in 2011. The arrival of Renault unlocked new opportunities for the company when
it won a contract for labor-intensive stamping. Tuyauto has invested in new machinery supported by a
20 percent investment subsidy from the Maroc PME Imtiaz program. The investment allowed the firm to
increase turnover and grow jobs by 50 percent, from 120 to 180. Tuyauto’s growth outlook is uncertain,
however, for two main reasons. First, demand for its product is today heavily dependent on orders from
Renault; this dependence makes investing expanding capacity by investing in more machines a risky
proposition. Moreover, Tuyauto’s production is specialized for one car model with a model lifetime of five
years. Beyond Renault, there are no other major buyers in local market today; PSA (Peugeot-Nissan) has
an established relationship with another supplier, Florecia, and is unlikely to shift to another. The entry of
more car manufacturers would make the investment in capacity more financially viable. Second, Tuyauto,
which is not physically based in Renault’s cluster or in an industrial zone, is at a disadvantage compared to
firms located in these zones. The exporters in free zones receive fiscal incentives for more than five years
and are geographically better positioned with more competitive logistics.
Dolidol is a leader in the manufacture of foam for the furniture and bedding industry in Morocco and
has successfully supplied the automotive industry since 2008. Established in 1970, Dolidol is part of the
diversified Berrada Group (Groupe Palmeraie). After Renault expanded its activities in Morocco, Dolidol
seized the opportunity to invest in a new niche, producing felt for the automotive industry. The share of
the automotive sector in the company’s production increased to 5 percent in 2017, and the objective is to
reach 40 percent. Dolidol has benefitted from some advantages relative to competitors: it has been able to
invest in a new plant on land owned by the Group, in the suburbs of Casablanca; it also has its own logistics
capacity with a fleet of more than 100 trucks. Moreover, the Group’s financial resources were critical as
they enabled it to undertake the initial investment and allowed it to sustain a loss during the first two
years. Dolidol is expanding its activities through a joint venture concluded in 2017 with the Spanish car
supplier Jobelsa to export locally manufactured automotive seating trim covers.

C. RECOMMENDATIONS
Foster effective implementation of the regulatory
framework for competition to:
» Limit exemptions from the application of the
Competition Law, notably for potential abuses of
dominance and non-transitory price controls.
» Establish a technical instance to prevent the
anticompetitive impact of mergers.
To enhance Competitive Neutrality, avoid market
distortions, and level the playing field between public
and private operators:
» Establish a definition for commercial/non-
commercial (public service) activities of SOEs
» Limit sector-specific regulatory privileges to SOEs
» Perform a subsidiarity analysis on commercial
activities of (new/existing) SOEs
» Limit exceptions to the application of program
contracts to SOEs (notably CDG)
» Eliminate corporate tax differences between SOEs
and private operators
» Require all sales and purchases of assets, goods
and services to be carried out through an open and
transparent tender procedure
To encourage the participation of domestic firms in
international value chains:
» Harmonize incentives to all exporters, direct or
indirect, who fulfill certain criteria (for example,
exporting 70 percent of production); location in
a free zone should not be the determinant — all
exporting firms, particularly domestic suppliers to
exporting firms, should receive the same, if any,
incentives.
» Map potential existing SMEs that could become
suppliers in the various clusters, in particular in the
expanding automotive sector.
» Reduce import tariffs (Most Favored Nation, or
MFN) on consumer goods to mitigate informal
trade and cross-border smuggling. n

BOX 5 Institut des Métiers de l’Aéronautique (IMA)
The institute was the first of the now 10 IGDs. Management of the institute is in thehands of Groupement
des Industries Marocaines Aeronautiques et Spatiales (GIMAS), the professional association of companies
in the aerospace industry in Morocco. Similar to other IGDs, the government, through the Ministere de
l’Education Nationale, de la Formation Professionnelle, de l’Enseignment Superier et de la Recherche
Scientifique provides the funding for IMA. The Institute has also received funding from AFD and has a
twinning arrangement with a French aerospace training center. Apparently, IMA has become a model for
other IGDs, which frequently seek the advice of the institute.
IMA is equipped with state-of-the-art equipment and appears as a well-managed center with a committee
and competent management team. Through GIMAS, the management maintains very close ties to the
aerospace companies operating in the country. The training courses, which have a duration of six to nine
months, are tailored to the specific needs and standards of the individual companies. The companies select
the trainees through an admission test (roughly 10 percent of applicants pass the text) and pay them a
stipend during the training. It is based on the alternate model, that is, about 50 percent of the training
takes place as on-the-job training. Upon completion of the training, the trainee receives a Certificate of
Qualification. The certificate does not provide accreditation for further training, however. More than 95
percent of those completing the training find a job in the industry.
Although the clients of IMA would be entitled to have part of the training sponsored under the Continuing
Education scheme, they do not appear to take advantage of this opportunity. The application procedure is
considered too bureaucratic and cumbersome, and not in line with the potential financial contribution.

BOX 6 Tiered organization of the automotive industry
The automotive industry is organized into ecosystems and includes two large French car manufacturers
(Renault and more recently PSA) and suppliers in Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3. It comprises about 160 firms,
mostly foreign firms and a few joint ventures (Figure below and Annex 9). The exception is the batteries
ecosystem, which is entirely composed of Moroccan firms.
The tiered supply chain model prevails in industries where the final product consists of complex
components and sub-assemblers (such as in the automotive and aeronautics sectors). Companies that
make the final product for sale to the consumer are referred to as original equipment manufacturers
(OEMs). First-tier (or Tier 1) suppliers provide components directly to the OEM. Tier 2 suppliers provide their
products (goods or services) to the first-tier suppliers, not directly to the OEM. Lower tiers provide less-
processed products (sub-assemblies, components, materials, all the way to raw materials).

BOX 7 Emerging players in the aerospace industry
China’s aviation sector is expected to be the world’s largest by 2024, producing not only aircraft
parts, but also fully manufactured commercial aircraft. The Chinese market, large and expanding,
is highly attractive to major companies, and both Airbus and Boeing have moved parts of their
manufacturing supply chains to China, a country the U.S. firm estimates will require $1.1 trillion worth of
aircraft over the next 20 years. However, growth is moderate, possibly due to sharply rising labor costs.
China is aiming for higher quality production, which causes the cost-competitive factor to fall. Hourly
manufacturing wages have increased by 12 percent annually since 2001, and productivity-adjusted
manufacturing wages nearly tripled from 2004 to 2014. In 2018, manufacturing wages average $4.71 per
hour (Trading Economics), higher than those in most other emerging countries.
Malaysia is seeking to become the region’s leading aerospace nation within the next 15 years,
when the sector is predicted to contribute $7.7 billion in revenues and provide 32,000 high-
income jobs. This growth is based on an expansion of the country’s fleet size and the rising migration
of commercial maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) activities to the Asia-Pacific region; the MRO
segment now accounts for 55 percent of the Malaysian aerospace industry. The country is at the forefront
of several markets, including composites design and manufacturing; aircraft components design and
manufacturing, avionics and systems design and manufacturing. Remaining challenges include rising
labor costs, with a manufacturing wage per hour averaging $5.32, some quality and logistics concerns, as
well as volatility of the trade policy and regulatory environment.
The Indian aerospace industry is one of the fastest-growing aerospace markets in the world in
terms of the number of aircraft orders and is likely to be the third-largest aviation market by 2025.
Demand will primarily support growth of low-cost carriers, which account for more than 60 percent
of the total flights in the country. The airline industry has been growing by 20 percent annually and
ordering new aircraft at a rapid pace. Importantly, the Indian government requires OEMs to source some
of the components from Indian suppliers. Moreover, India’s strategic location in South East Asia, and its
rapidly developing engineering workforce, services and R&D, position it as a potential global hub for both
manufacturing and MRO. India’s very low production costs, with manufacturing wages averaging $3.40
per hour, give it a major competitive advantage. Nevertheless, the country has little track record in the
aerospace industry, particularly in the design and integration of commercial aircraft, limited scale in all
segments of the industry’s value chain, and no significant supplier base.
The Mexican aerospace industry boasts annual exports of $8 billion, supporting more than
60,000 jobs, and comprising more than 330 aerospace companies, a 65 percent increase since 2009.
Growth of the sector rests on Mexico’s proximity to the United States and Canada, and the existence of
bilateral agreements such as NAFTA that allow exemptions from import duties, which have allowed the
decentralization of aerospace components and assembly manufacturing activities. Mexico is one of the
most competitive countries in terms of aerospace manufacturing labor costs, with an average wage of
just $2.50 per hour in 2018. The Mexican government has strengthened and developed national suppliers,
supported the creation of clusters, infrastructure, and certifications. A sourcing council made up of
major suppliers was established to determine the missing links in Mexican supply chains and to attract
talent and promote the establishment of international supply businesses. The aerospace industry is still
relatively young and has yet to see the rise of all support industries that are a necessary complement
for the major suppliers to consider outsourcing to Mexico. There is also a lack of coordination between
operators and authorities, and a lack of connectivity through logistics infrastructure, which tend to affect
the production distribution nodes.

practical training, a structured program could be
reproduced to enable students to become interns with
companies while pursuing their studies.
TRANSFER COSTS. Transfer costs for foreign investors
are high and could be prohibitive for some firms. These
costs include the cost to transfer the machinery and
work packages to another country, the cost to install
machinery and to train the new employees in their use,
the learning curve of performance and the scrapping
of material during the learning curve, and expatriation
costs. Due to the complexity of the aerospace industry,
these costs are particularly high. Moroccan subsidy
programs do not cover these two costs.
Recommendation: Consider expanding the incentive
programs to cover transfer costs, which could have a
major impact on growth in the Moroccan aerospace
industry.
ACCESS TO FINANCING. To benefit from subsidies, local
companies and entrepreneurs are required to work
with Moroccan banks. However, local banks do not
provide investment or cash-flow support, charge high
interest rates and require significant collateral. This
creates a major barrier to entry for new firms into the
aerospace sector. Without proper financial support, it is
difficult for start-ups to emerge and SMEs to invest in
innovations.
Recommendation: Evaluate the possibility of a well-
designed support program for local companies and
entrepreneurs, perhaps along the lines of assistance
currently provided to the SME sector (for example,
guarantees, co-financing). n

Notes: This list was established in 2012. Many updates have been made since that year and need to be taken into consideration (the updated
list of this Law is not available on internet). For example, the organic law No 17.08 added three new public establishments to this list:
1. Agence marocaine de développement des investissements et des exportations
2. Agence de développement numérique
3. Fonds de solidarité contre les événements catastrophiques
In addition, in 2014, the Moroccan state, the CDG as well as the OCP sold their shares in BCP. Only the CMR (Caisse Marocaine des
Retraites) remains shareholder with 5.89 percent as of December 2017 (company’s annual report 2017). This company will likely be deleted
from the original list.

Notes: The list of companies with state shareholdings is not exhaustive. This study focused on the largest companies with a significant
market capitalization (higher than MAD 3 billion). The market capitalization was recorded on May 15 2018; CIMR: Caisse
Interprofessionnelle Marocaine de Retraites ; CMR: Caisse Marocaine des Retraites ; RCAR: Régime Collectif d’Allocation de Retraite ;
FIPAR Holding is a private equity owned by the CDG with an investment strategy designed to provide support for both national operators
promoting major projects and international operators seeking to establish a presence or develop strategic partnerships in Morocco.” FIPAR
is a leading private equity investor in Morocco, managing 7 MAD billion of assets; Massira Capital is a private equity owned by the CDG;
cash flow rights are the percentage of shares owned in the total issued shares. They can be defined as the total claim of the shareholder on
each Euro of earnings generated by the controlled firm. Given prudential standards, pension funds must invest the bulk of their reserves
in listed securities to safeguard the interests of their retail investors (present and future pensioners). The mandate to manage the assets of
RCAR, the largest pension fund in the country (for SOE employees), with assets amounting to approximately 10 percent of GDP, rests with
CDG. As agent, CDG invests according to benchmarks set by the RCAR investment committee, which in turn follows the regulations of the
pension and insurance regulator (ACAPS).

**The notion of “politically connected firms” is severely underestimated as the table only accounts for the market participation of the three
economics groups covered by Table 2.
Table sources:
1 ONHYM, ONEE’s hydrocarbons subsidiary, competes with Afriquia Gaz, the market leader in liquified gas distribution (which is also
involved in gas import operations), with a market share of 46 percent in Liquified Petroleum Gas distribution and 20 percent of gas stations
at national level, owned by the politically connected Akwa Group. Afriquiq Gaz has recently be subject of a social boycott on certain brands,
among which are Afriquia Gas’ stations.
2 Maroc telecom (IAM) has a strong international presence through ten subsidiaries operating in fixed-line services, internet services and/or
mobile services: Mauritel (Mauritania) (41.2 percent IAM); Onatel (Burkina Faso) (51 percent IAM); Gabon Telecom (Gabon) (51 percent
IAM); Sotelma (Mali) (51 percent IAM); Atlantique Telecom Côte d’Ivoire (85 percent IAM); Etisalat Bénin (100 percent IAM); Atlantique
Telecom Togo (100 percent IAM); Atlantique Telecom Niger (100 percent IAM); Atlantique Telecom Centrafrique (100 percent IAM);
Prestige Telecom Côte d’Ivoire (100 percent IAM). Maroc Telecom (IAM) is the market leader in telecommunications, with a market share
of 60 percent, but competes with two other operators, Inwi, a subsidiary of the politically connected Al-Mada Group (former SNI or ONA),
and Orange Maroc in mobile services. It has a quasi-monopole in ADSL (internet services) and fixed-line services.
3 Among others, Maroc Telecom competes in the IT with companies such as Mercure.com, an IT subsidiary of the politically connected Al-
Mada Group.
4 Royal Air Maroc (RAM) has twelve subsidiaries (Air Transport): RAM Express (100 percent), Atlas Servair (60 percent), Aerotechnique
Industrie (50 percent), Snecma Morocco Engine Services (SMES) (49 percent), RAM Vending (100 percent), Atlas Online (100 percent), Casa
Aero (50 percent), Amadeus Maroc (70 percent), Atlas Multiservices (AMS) (100 percent), RAM Handling (100 percent), STTS MA (50.1
percent), RAM Cargo (100 percent). Royal Air Maroc competes with politically connected airlines such as Air Arabia Maroc, participated
by the Holmarcom Group.
5 OCP is a market leader with a monopoly in phosphate mining and processing in the domestic market. Eighty percent of its commercial
activity is international. It has more than ten subsidiaries and JVs in mining and processing at national and international level combined, as
well as ten other subsidiaries and JVs in other sectors. Some of its partners are private international companies such as DuPont de Nemours,
Jacobs Engineering or IBM, among others. It also holds partnerships with international SOEs. For instance, it participates in Paradeep
Phosphates Limited (PPL) (80.45 percent owned by ZMPL) through its 50 percent ownership of ZMPL, where the other 50 percent is
owned by the Indian Government. OCP’s main subsidiaries in mining and processing are Prayon S.A. (45 percent), Phosphates de Boucraa
S.A. (100 percent), Euro Maroc Phosphore (EMPAHOS) (33.3 percent), Jorf Fertilizer Company V (JFC V) (95.58 percent), and Pakistan
Maroc Phosphore (PAKMAROC) (47.79 percent). In International and Trading: Black Sea Fertilizer Trading Co. (BSFT) (70 percent), OCP
Africa (100 percent), SAFTCO (95 percent), OCP International (95.58 percent). Subsidiaries in engineering and consulting are: Dupont Ocp
Operations Consulting (50 percent), Jacobs Engineerings S.A. (50 percent), Transportation Engineering and Management Consultants (Team
Maroc) (100 percent), and TEAL Technology Services (JV: 50 percent (50 percent IBM)). It also operates in other sectors such as ecosystem
development, where it owns two main subsidiaries, Societe d’Amenagement et de Developpement Vert (SADV) (100 percent), and Societe
d’Amenagement et de Developpement de Mazagan (SADM) (100 percent).
6 As a pension management fund, its core activity, CDG manages the National Pension and Insurance Fund (Caisse Nationale de Retraites et
d’Assurances, CNRA) and the Collective Retirement Benefit Scheme (Régime Collectif d’Allocation de Retraite, RCAR).
7 In the territorial development sector, CDG carries out an intense activity as well. It operates, through subsidiaries, as a real estate developer.
It develops industrial zones, where it holds 80 percent market share of duty-free zones development, as well as residential areas, offices and
shopping centers, industries, and new urban areas.
8 CDG operates as a tourism and hotel developer through subsidiaries like SAPST (of which it owns 45 percent), Saidia (66 percent), Madaef
(100 percent), or Sothermy (99 percent).
9 CDG has seven main subsidiaries in finance and investment: CDG Capital (CDG Gestion, CDG Bourse, CDG Private Equity, CDG Capital
Infrastructures) (100 percent), CIH Bank (65.88 percent), FINEA (99 percent). In this sector it competes with banks such as Attijariwafa
Bank, the market leader (for instance, with a 35 percent of market share in investment credit), owned by the Al-Mada Group. In Insurance,
CDG competes with Wafa Assurance, the market leader with a 20.8 percent of market share, a subsidiary of Al-Mada. Société Centrale de
Reassurance (CSR), a subsidiary of CDG, holds a dominant position in the market. Other competitors are Atlanta Assurance, a subsidiary of
the politically connected Holmarcom Group.
10 CDG has created an ESCO (Energy Services Company) in partnership with ONEE and the Moroccan Agency for Energy Efficiency (AMEE)
for the provision of energy efficiency services.

relationships. The employment regime was clarified
with the establishment of employee profiles and clear
pay policies. Important resources were allocated to
training, both technical and managerial (in partnership
with top international academic institutions) and
to modernizing information systems to allow for
transversal communication. A recruitment campaign
was also launched to cope with the increase in
production (expected to generate thousands of new
jobs in the near future), rejuvenate the workforce, and
replace retiring employees, resulting in a net growth
of the workforce. Similarly, the externalization of the
pension system, initiated in 2001, was completed.
Overall, the cost of the workforce has slightly increased
since corporatization (which is probably traceable to
a series of social measures implemented in 2011 in the
wake of the Arab Spring). As of 2012 it still represented
the third highest line of expense.
It is extremely difficult to link governance reforms
with specific performance changes. However, from
interviews of various stakeholders, the recent reforms
of OCP management had enabled better performance.
For example, the OCP’s contribution to the Moroccan
state is increasing. As of 2012, the OCP’s total
financial contribution to the state (taxes and dividends)
amounted to DH 4.72 billion (or over $500 million),
making it the main contributor among SOEs to the
state budget. Today, the OCP remains the world’s
largest exporter of phosphate products, and it holds
stakes in the capital of several subsidiaries, mostly in
the chemical industry but not exclusively (e.g., real
estate), including a series of joint ventures in emerging
markets such as Brazil, India, and Turkey.

found that they identify 15.4 million hectares of
land, or 34.5 percent, as collectively managed, with
another 300,000 hectares of irrigated land that has
since been privatized (USAID 2011, MoI). This land
is managed in a combination of central control with
local administration, resulting in a highly complex
and opaque system of tenure practice, which is often
unintelligible to outsiders (Scott 1998).

department, publications, and must be constructed (as
no long-term leases are possible) in urban areas (while
land is scarce and expensive).
The appointment of an educational director at any

institutions may be authorized to access courses and

While the use of stringent standards to obtain
accreditation and recognition pursue a justified
public policy rationale, the differential treatment
between institutions building upon partnerships with
subsidiaries of SOEs and those building upon private
capital unduly unlevel the playing field. On the one
hand, this type of discriminatory treatment distorts the
incentives for private operators to enter the market and
provide education services. On the other hand, the role
of SOE subsidiaries in the provision of these services
might not be compliant with the subsidiary role of the
state in the economy.

1 The automotive industry is organized into ecosystems with suppliers in Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3. Companies that make the final product
for sale to the consumer are referred to as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Tier 1 suppliers provide components directly to the
OEM. Tier 2 suppliers provide their products (goods or services) to the first-tier suppliers, not directly to the OEM. Lower tiers provide less-
processed products (sub-assemblies, components, materials, all the way to raw materials).

probably be even higher if substantial nonwage benefits in the public sector, such as various allowances, retirement benefits, and job security
were included—information that is generally not available.” IMF, 2018, Public Wage Bills in the Middle East and Central Asia.
3 Necessity entrepreneurs are individuals who start small enterprises out of necessity. While they range from street sellers to those with
higher education but with little access to formal employment what unites them is the need to survive. Entrepreneurs by choice are typically
characterized by their willingness to take risks and by a motivation to achieve. They drop other viable sources of income and a comfortable
lifestyle to create something of their own.

Orange) and BMCE Bank jointly started a cash platform in 2013. These two services are not widely used in Morocco.

16 The concept of hidden capabilities is used in economic complexity and fitness analysis: a country’s productive structure shines a light on the
capabilities it possesses, and the new opportunities that can be reached. This line of research portrays economic growth as the evolution of
an ecosystem of technologies and industrial capabilities. Analytical approaches offer new opportunities to empirically map these ecosystems
within countries and industries in order to understand their dynamics and measure their fitness. The approach is based on historical data
and represents a filter of potential opportunities. To determine concrete investment areas, it combines results with a forward-looking market
demand analysis.
17 The law distinguishes three main categories: public organizations, limited liability companies in which the state holds shares, directly or
indirectly, exclusively or partially, and joint-ventures with a concession contract (companies entrusted with operating a service of general
economic interest, pursuant to a concession contract in which the state in the contracting authority).

ONCF (Office national de chemins de fer); CDG (Caisse de dépôt et de gestion); RAM (Royal Air Maroc); TMSA (Agence speciale Tanger
Mediterranee).
19 While CDG reports the use of two criteria: additionality (in the business model or subject matter) and structural character (of their
contribution to a given market when proposing the creation of new subsidiaries) public authorities as well as other business operators indicate
the prevalence of overall profitability as main driver for these decisions without consideration for the position of the private operators already
in the market.
20 This is confirmed by SOEs interviewed during the CPSD mission. See paragraph below for further details.
21 The Caisse de Dépôt et de Gestion (CDG) invests on the Casablanca stock exchange as an agent of RCAR, Morocco’s largest pension fund,
with a portfolio estimated at $9.5 billion as of May 2018, accounting for 22 percent of total market capitalization.
22 See CDG’s Annual Report 2016, page 22, that include land management among its core activities. At the same time, several sources report
difficulties for private investors to access land. This is considered one of the main constraints for investment. See Morocco’s Growth

23 In discussions with SOEs and legal professionals advising on public-private JVs, there is a general consensus that SOEs enter into these types
of agreements as if they were private operators, that is, on the basis of the reputation of a company or their position as market leaders abroad,
without considering open/competitive appeals/tenders that could provide the opportunity for other firms to offer better conditions in terms of
efficiency, innovation.
24 For instance, in the United Kingdom, following general EU procurement rules, SOEs should follow a competitive selection process, including
a prequalification of bidders, to enter into JVs. See “Joint Ventures: a guidance note for public sector bodies forming joint ventures with the
private sector,” UK HM Treasury (2010) at p. 3 on how competitive procedures apply for “Joint Ventures (JVs) where both a public sector
body and the private sector contribute to a commercial venture and agree to develop and manage that business on a joint basis.” These JVs
are governed by company law. Moreover, on p. 8 the report discusses some regulated exceptions in which EU procurement rules do not apply.
However, generally, the selection of JV partners consists of different steps such as issue of information memorandum, pre-qualification of
bidders, dialogue phase, agreement on initial form of business plan, agreement on forms of document, calls for final tenders, identification
of preferred partner(s), and due diligence. Available at http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130102211814/http://www.hm-treasury.

30 Following the standard in the literature, market power is proxied using the price–cost margin, which is derived from the Lerner Index. The
PCM measures margins (that is, the difference between price and marginal cost) as a proportion of price. In the absence of information on
price and marginal cost, the extent of pricing power in an industry is proxied by the difference between value added and labor costs as a
proportion of sales (all measured in current prices), as follows:
PCMi =
(salesi - cost - materialsi - labor - costi)
salesi
Sales, material cost, and salaries are all taken from the Enterprise Survey. Financial costs of capital are not included in the average costs.
31 Enterprise Survey was conducted in 2013 in Tunisia, and in 2016 for Egypt.
32 A cross-section regression was estimated to explain price cost margin performance using the following firm characteristics as covariates:
labor intensity (measured as the number of full time employees), age (measured in age categories), ownership (if foreign owned or not), sector
of operation (captured through two digit sector fixed effects) and country (captured by Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt dummies). The predicted
value of the price cost margin for Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt, after controlling for all those covariates is displayed in Figure 8. These results
are robust when restricting the analysis to manufacturing firms only.
33 In an effort to promote competition, ANRT prioritized the issue of local loop unbundling as early as 2004 through a decision resulting in
negotiations with the incumbent Maroc Telecom which needed to provide technical specifications about its legacy copper infrastructure
and pricing options for operator access. However, it was not until an order from the Prime Minister that dates were set for implementation
of local loop unbundling—with partial unbundling expected by January 2007 and full unbundling by July 2008. A final agreement on full
unbundling was reached on December 27, 2007 after a series of correspondence between ANRT and Maroc Telecom. This also included new
modifications to pricing of partial unbundling. See also Decision ANRT/DG/No.19 (December 26, 2014).
34 The Moroccan telecoms company Inwi filed a lawsuit against Maroc Telecom (IAM) for non-compliance with regulatory provisions related

36 Law 48-15 available at https://www.droit-afrique.com/uploads/Maroc-Loi-2015-48-regulation-secteur-electricite.pdf. Recent analysis
suggests that Morocco lags its peers in terms of implementing intended reforms in the electricity sector. According to a Global Power Sector
Reform Index, Morocco is ranked 55 out of 88 on four dimensions of reform (regulation, competition, private sector participation and
restructuring). The areas of weakest reform efforts are regulation and restructuring. When compared to its middle-income peers, Morocco’s
progress in enhancing competition is not that strong—countries such as Argentina, Turkey, Guatemala, Mexico, Romania and Ghana have
all done more to promote competition (World Bank, 2017a). As for restructuring, draft legislation to unbundle the sector and introduce
competition in generation and commercial activities was prepared by the government in the early years of 2000 and ONE went as far as
floating a tender for developing generation capacity with no guarantees as to purchasing the power produced. This process came to a halt in
2008 with the emphasize shifting to generation projects-based reforms instead of pushing for deep institutional reforms (Amegroud, 2016).

38 In late 2014, Morocco eliminated subsidies for gasoline, diesel, and fuel oil, dramatically reducing outlays that weighted on the country’s
budget and current account. However, Decision No. 3086.14 of the Deputy Minister at the Prime Minister issued on 29 December 2014

whose prices can be determined by the state as follows: National flour for soft wheat; Sugar; Tobacco industry; Electricity; Drinking water;
Liquid cleansing; Butane gas; Transportation of road passengers; Pharmaceutical products; Business and medical services in the private
medical sector; Work done by private nurses and nurses in the private sector; School books; Contracts of judicial commissioners; Notaries’

40 OECD, Roundtable on Competition Neutrality, Issues paper by the Secretariat, 2015, 4.
41 This is a preliminary assessment mainly focused on what is “on the books.” Accounting for a detailed assessment of implementation across
sectors could identify additional concerns.
42 There is no formal definition of public services/non-commercial activities and this constitutes a critical gap in the Moroccan for the
implementation of the competitive neutrality principle in Morocco. While Article 6 of the Law 15-95 (Commercial Code) establishes
18 activities identified as commercial acts, some of them could also correspond/be provided as public services, that is, transportation,
distribution of water, electricity and gas, or posts and telecommunications.
43 Law No. 69-00 makes no distinction on the SOEs based on the nature of the activity: both institutions with a commercial purpose and
institutions focusing on “social activities” are included within the scope of application of the law (World Bank 2015). While there is no
general requirement to separate commercial and non-commercial activities of SOEs, some of them identify “public service” obligations for
which they get a compensation. This is the case of RAM that holds different accounting lines for unprofitable routes served on the basis of
agreements with different regions to ensure connectivity. The lack of separation between commercial and non-commercial activities implies
lack of separation between costs and revenues related to commercial/no-commercial activities. However, given the advanced accounting
obligations of SOEs, when there is clarity on the provision of a given good/service as per non-commercial obligation, then costs and revenues
of this services are clearly allocated. This is the case of non-profitable domestic routes for RAM.
44 There is no general obligation for SOEs to separate commercial and non-commercial activities and this impacts the ability to supervise
the allocation of costs and capital return to commercial activities. SOEs are not accountable for the return of their investments. However,
positive NPV is required for SOEs when creating a new subsidiary. To do so, SOEs must have the approval of the Ministry of Finance and
they are asked to provide a business plan with an estimation of the NPV. Moreover, while SOEs present a positive operating balance as a
group, the amount of operating deficit accrued by under-performing SOEs has increased during the last three years (Ministère de l’Economie
et des Finances du Maroc 2017).
45 Only certain SOEs are subject to corporate tax. Although Article 2 of the General Tax Code explicitly subjects “Companies regardless of
their form and purpose” as well as public institutions to corporate income tax, Article 6 exempts some SOEs from its application.
46 While no reference has been found to preferential rates applied to SOE loans by state-owned banks, the Court of Audits report that
internal debt of SOEs is declining and only represents 33.9 percent of total debts by SOEs. In contrast, the Court draws the attention to the
considerable amount of external debt that is being accrued by SOEs in the last years. It is noteworthy that a considerable majority of such
external debt is guaranteed by the state.
47 Some SOEs (either in general or for specific types of contracts) are exempted from the application of the public procurement law (Articles 2
and 4 of Decree 2-12-349); however, they report to follow similar procedures in order to ensure their position before the Cour de Comptes.
For instance, in the case of CDG, the selection of real estate promoters does not follow the general public procurement framework, but they
issue call for tenders where the selection is based on general criteria of price and quality. Nevertheless, SOEs also enter into a variety of
agreements with private operators (for example, JVs, concessions) that are expressly exempted from the public procurement law.
48 See Article 2 of Law No. 104-12 on freedom of prices and protection of competition. Available at http://adala.justice.gov.ma/production/

52 Case S/0331/11: NAVIERAS MARRUECOS of the National Competition Authority. In 2016, the Spanish National High Court overturned
the National Competition Authority’s decision on formal grounds due to the deficiencies in the inspections used to gather the relevant
evidence for the case, thus revoking the fines imposed to six of the eleven companies, including Comarit and IMTC. See Rulings SAN
4950/2016 and SAN 4957/2016 available at https://www.cnmc.es/expedientes/s033111. For more information see “Transport & Logistics
sector Morocco” (Netherlands Enterprise Agency, 2018) available at https://www.rvo.nl/sites/default/files/2018/03/Transport-and-Logistics-
sector-Morocco.pdf.
53 The calculation of this percentage considers:
The amount of the fines represents 10 percent of the companies’ turnover for one fiscal year. Therefore, we use this value to calculate the
total revenue for one year.
We consider an average overcharge for the duration of the cartel of 20 percent as it varied across years from 15 to 25 percent.
The fine covers eight years of the cartel (although it lasted longer in time).
By multiplying total revenue per number of years (8) and average overcharge, we have a proxy of the illicit gains of the cartel.
Finally, we assess the proportion of the fine in relation to the illicit gains.

the banks; and (d) MEF pays the banks as and when the IOUs fall due. This factoring scheme removed one cause of payment delays starting
in 2018.

73 Trade credit insurance creates distinct benefits for SMEs and other beneficiary firms, notably: (a) Balance-sheet protection. Sales receivables
are a major (often the largest) item in a firm’s balance-sheet. Like fixed assets and inventories, receivables need to be insured. Insuring
receivables against credit risk increases the stability and predictability of sales cash flows, thus reducing the likelihood of insolvencies and
their knock-on effect on the supply chains; (b) Access to finance. Receivables backed by credit insurance may be used by sellers to raise
finance without pledging fixed assets to their bank. Forms of receivable financing (also called invoice financing) include invoice discounting
and invoice factoring. Invoice discounting may be with or without recourse to the seller in case of payment default of the buyer. In the case
of invoice factoring, invoices are acquired by a factoring company (in Morocco, typically the subsidiary of one of the leading banks) which is
in turn insured by a credit insurer. Market sources indicate that Morocco could still further expand invoice discounting and factoring.
74 Maroc Telecom has undergone several rounds of privatization, starting in January 2001, when it transferred 35 percent of its capital, and
the management control, to Vivendi Universal for MAD 23.3 billion ($2.3 billion). Vivendi’s share increased to 53 percent before it sold it
in 2014 to Etisalat, the Gulf’s biggest telephone operator, which is majority owned by the Abu Dhabi government (Financial Times, 2013).
These reforms brought significant benefits for the Moroccan economy and led to the spectacular development of mobile telephony extending
even to remote and disadvantaged regions.
75 IAM for its Arabic name, Itissalat Al Maghrib.
76 Earlier this year, one of the operators filed a damage claim of $620 million against Maroc Télécom for lack of infrastructure sharing before
the commercial courts. While fixed line access is limited in Morocco, this move reflects the need for a regulatory/institutional framework
able to foster competition in the sector.
77 This is the third attempt after Maroc Telecom launched the Mobicash service in 2010 in partnership with Attijariwafa Bank, and Meditel
(now Orange) and BMCE Bank jointly started a cash platform in 2013. These two services are not widely used in Morocco.
78 The application of those preferences is referenced in tender documents.
79 Measures to support local content can be indirect or indirect For example, in the energy sector, indirect measures include investments for the
creation of new generation capacity, maintenance activity, engineering or a research and development center, and direct measures include: (a)
the acquisition of equipment produced in the country with a defined minimum value-added in the country; (b) the contracting of services in
relation to the construction of plants, to be performed locally, with companies incorporated locally; and (c) the accommodation and catering
expenses, works and furniture supplies, office material and supplies, telecommunication system installation, temporary office supplies, office
electrical supplies, fuel supply, office rental, among others.

83 The CDG, French for Deposit and Management Fund, is a state-owned financial institution which manages long-term savings in Morocco.
The CDG handles in particular the savings of the RCAR (Régime Collectif d’Allocations de Retraite) and the CNRA (Caisse Nationale de
Retraites et d’Assurances) pension funds which groups the retirement contributions of the employees of state-owned companies and agencies.
Between 2005 and 2008, CDG gained substantially in funds when it acquired the management of the retirement savings of the OCP, the
world’s leading phosphate producer and exporter. Given its substantial assets it also acts as a large investor in the country, especially in the
tourism sector. It possesses many subsidiaries operating in various sectors of the Economy. CDG is modelled after the French fund Caisse des
Dépôts et Consignations.

87 This section is largely based on the World Bank Group’s Maghreb infrastructure Diagnostic: Enabling Private Investment and Commercial
Financing in Infrastructure in Morocco, draft, August 2018.

89 Electricity is noted as a major constraint by 24.5 percent of manufacturing firms in the most Morocco recent enterprise survey.
90 Infrastructure is defined here as the sum of all transport networks (airports, ports, rail, and roads) and of all utilities (energy, ICT, and water
and sanitation). It excludes social infrastructure (chiefly education and health).
91 According to OECD estimates, ODA disbursements to Morocco’s infrastructure amounted to 1.7 percent of GDP in 2016. Other official
flows (OOF—those with a concessionality below 25 percent) amounted to another 0.8 percent of GDP. Relative to the size of its population,
Morocco receives higher ODA flows (particularly for financing infrastructure) than most other countries.
92 The leading SOEs engaged in infrastructure are: ONEE (electricity and water supply), ADM (highways), ONCF (railways), Masen (renewable
energy), ONDA (airports), ANP (ports), and TMSA (ports). In addition, the state also has a 30 percent stake in Maroc Telecom, one of the
three major telecom operators in the country. The state also still owns 60 percent of the port operator Marsa Maroc, which was partially
privatized in 2016.
93 About 30 PPPs were undertaken between 1986 and 2017, almost all of them as concessions or involving the delegation of services in
commercial sectors, including highways, urban transport, water and electricity distribution, sanitation, household solid waste collection,
electricity generation, irrigation, and the management of agricultural land. These PPPs were negotiated either by local collectives or by
contract with the state on a case-by-case basis. While urban transport concessions have not all proved successful, concessions for water and
electricity distribution and sanitation have shown good results.
94 The first proposal was for the construction and maintenance of the Bab Ouendar Dam, which was rejected. The second was for the
construction, co-financing, operation, and maintenance of a desalination station and a wind park in Dakhla. The project was approved by
the commission for preliminary evaluations and the Minister of Finance, and a call for tenders is underway.
95 Although the incentives offered to firms investing in the automotive and aeronautics sectors create an uneven playing field (and contribute to
a more complex tax system via tax exemptions) since they are not available to all investors, it is important to note that their objective is to
attract the entry of leading firms in support of globally competitive exports. The instances described in Chapter III, an uncompetitive playing
field leads to the opposite result, namely protecting incumbents and discouraging of entry of new firms.

97 Established in 1971, the OFPPT was initially dedicated to continuous training for employees. Then, the OFPPT received a social mandate
and became an instrument for the inclusion of youth (outside of the education system) in the job market. All training is designed with the
participation of the relevant industry professionals. Its executive board includes representatives from the state, the private sector, and the
unions.
98 The levy is collected at source (from the employer) by CNSS (Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale) along with other taxes and social
contributions. Moreover, the budget spent on TVET corresponds to 0.2 percent of GDP (excluding budget spent on PPPs). For comparison
purposes, the government spends about 27 percent of its budget on education, or 5.3 percent of GDP.

100 Although many European Tier 1 suppliers, as part of their strategy, and to protect their European market shares against newcomers, are
moving more of their activities to Morocco.
101 As an example, for Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers, the local content increase imposed by the government on car manufacturers, and the
development of the metal and stamping, and engines and transmissions, ecosystem implies accelerating the development of new suppliers,
particularly for following areas: heat treatment, surface coating, machining, cast iron foundry, aluminum casting, plastic parts and plastic
part coating, and coil springs. The automotive industry lacks companies able to design and manufacture press tooling, plastic molds,
machining and assembly tooling. Most of these products rely on medium or heavy investment (cast iron foundry, aluminum casting) and
more importantly, depth of knowledge. This means that it will be necessary to either negotiate an alliance/joint venture with existing players,
or provide significant technical support to local players. The development of Tier 2 firms should be based on association with existing
players, or through relocation to Morocco by specialist companies. In the case of Tier 3 firms, the type of assistance would depend on the
capital intensity of the activity. For highly capital-intensive products or processes, such as cast-iron foundry or plastic molding, significant
knowledge and high levels of investment are required, implying the need for a merger with a specialist firm or direct investment by such a
firm. For suppliers of less capital-intensive products, association with specialist firms is not critical.

131 Despite significant improvements in disclosure in Morocco, information remains insufficient and sometimes difficult to verify. The
developments described in the rest of this section are subject to this general caveat.
132 The monopoly applies to exploitation but also to the distribution and commercialization of phosphates and their by-products.
133 Despite provisions of the Law 01-00 enacted in 2000, private universities had to wait the implementing decree enacted in 2010 to formally
obtain the name of university and be recognized as such by the public administration. Prior to this, they were operating only as schools,
institutes, or centers.
134 However, the requirements included in the specifications for accreditation tend to be more input-based and do not ensure quality of student
outcomes.
