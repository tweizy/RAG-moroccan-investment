10. Renewable energy in Morocco
Soukaina Boudoudouh (L'Institut de Recherche en Énergie Solaire et Énergies Nouvelles)
Morocco's national energy strategy has evolved rapidly to meet the policy
challenge of increasing energy demands, environmental commitments and
reliance on energy imports. As an emerging economy with limited fossil fuel
resources, Morocco has focused on developing sustainable and local energy
sources and has set ambitious targets to spur investment in renewable electricity.
This is exemplified by the successful development of the world’s largest
concentrating solar power (CSP) plant in 2016, as well as a range of efforts in
energy efficiency. As Morocco has moved into new technology fields, including
solar PV, hydrogen and batteries, it has been guided and supported by new
institutions, including the Institute for Research in Solar Energy and New Energies
(IRESEN), which focuses exclusively on R&D and innovation related to renewable
energy.
IRESEN has ensured that the strategic goal of technology leadership has received
sufficient attention in alignment with the national vision for renewable energy. It
has come to play a central role in research and innovation in renewable energy in
Morocco and also in international co-operation. It develops pilot projects and
facilitates collaboration between academia and industry. This institutional
innovation has been highly successful and demonstrates the value of fostering
technical expertise within government and co-ordinating the actions of academic
and private actors. However, this model has also raised challenges of financial
continuity.
Country context
Morocco is the third-largest economy in North Africa by GDP and the third-largest
in terms of population. It is classified as a lower middle-income country, and has
per-capita national income 45% higher than the average of all lower middle-
income countries and just 18% lower than the upper middle-income threshold. Its
economy has expanded robustly in the past two decades at an annual average
rate of 3.8% between 2000 and 2021, although the rate has been below that
average for the period since 2010 at 2.8%.
Progress in diversifying the economy and boosting growth has been hit in recent
years by several crises, including the global pandemic, inflationary pressures,
commodity price volatility and the Al Haouz earthquake in 2023, as well as
tightening global financing conditions. Nonetheless, Morocco has demonstrated a

capacity to respond to shocks in recent years. It managed the humanitarian
response to the earthquake and has a development plan to unlock the
development potential of the most affected provinces.
More broadly, foreign direct investment has consistently flowed into Morocco in
recent years and is increasingly directed towards the manufacturing sector.
Various modern industrial niches well connected to global value chains have
emerged and the country maintained access to international capital markets
despite the ongoing tightening of global financial conditions. Exports of cars rose
27% in 2023 to USD 14 billion.
The European Union is Morocco's largest trading partner. In 2022, 56% of
Morocco's exports went to the European Union and 45% of Morocco's imports
came from the bloc. EU imports from Morocco amounted to EUR 22.9 billion, and
were led by transport equipment (23.5%), machinery and appliances (21.2%) and
textiles (14.3%). EU exports to Morocco amounted to EUR 33.3 billion. They were
led by machinery and appliances (21.2%), followed by mineral products (15.5%)
and transport equipment (11.1%).
In the global context, Morocco’s human development index score is relatively
strong and has risen continually since 1990. It ranks 120 out of 189 countries on
this measure, just one place below the “high human development” category.
Morocco is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy, whereby the king has some
powers to appoint the prime minister and guide policy, in addition to the elected
government.
Energy sector context
Morocco’s energy system is dominated by coal and oil, and it imports more energy
each year than any other African country. In 2021, 89% of Morocco’s final energy
needs were met by imported fossil fuels, mostly oil. This makes its economy
particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil and gas prices. The country’s
energy demand has risen steadily over the past two decades, with electricity
demand rising faster than GDP, at an annual average rate of 4%, and other energy
uses rising at 2%, more slowly than GDP. As a result, Morocco’s CO emissions
2
from fuel combustion are on an upward trend, rising at an average of 3.5% per
year since 2010 and reaching 67 million tonnes in 2021. These CO emissions
2
come almost exclusively from the burning of imported fuel, which is often used in
inefficient conversion technologies – coal-fired power plants and internal
combustion engines. This means that significantly more energy content is
imported than is required to replace the same fossil fuels with domestic electricity
sources, including for use in electric vehicles. This brings a double dividend of
lowering import bills as well as emissions.

The Ministry of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development (MTEDD) is
responsible for Morocco’s energy policy. It is accountable for security of supply,
energy market rules and authorising and supervising projects. It has a mandate to
promote energy efficiency and renewable energy. MTEDD oversees the Office
National de l’Électricité et de l’Eau Potable (ONEE), which is a legally and
financially autonomous public entity with monopoly ownership of the electricity
transmission system. It generates around one-third of the country’s electricity and
is involved in the purchase and sale of all electricity sold via the national grid. In
2008 a law was passed to create an Energy Development Fund.
Morocco has made significant strides in providing universal access to electricity,
to the extent that it is no longer a major policy focus for the country. This milestone
was achieved in 2017, marking a critical success in the nation's energy policy.
This achievement distinguishes Morocco from several other countries on the
African continent and highlights its commitment to improving living standards and
fostering economic development through reliable energy access. The completion
rate of the Global Rural Electrification Programme had reached 99.85% by the
end of 2022.
In 2009 Morocco made the strategic decision to maximise the use of its domestic
renewable resources to increase energy security and limit CO emissions. The
2
2009 National Energy Strategy committed the country to increasing the share of
renewables to 42% of electricity capacity by 2020 and improving energy efficiency
by 12% by 2020 and 15% by 2030. This is in the context of the united goals of
sustainable development, energy security and independence from fossil fuel
imports. The renewables target was further broken down into 2 GW of solar, 2 GW
of wind and 2 GW of hydropower. At the time, Morocco’s installed solar and wind
capacity was around 0.2 GW in total, while hydropower was at 1.8 GW. This
strategic shift has led to significant changes in Morocco’s electricity mix, with
renewables reaching 19% of total generation in 2021 (Figure 10.1). Solar and wind
electricity have almost entirely displaced the use of oil in electricity generation,
which reached a high point in 2012 and declined to just 3% in 2021, and imports
of electricity. However, solar and wind have not yet compensated for lower hydro
output in recent years, or the lower imports of natural gas in the recent higher-
price environment – these changes have so far been covered by more coal-fired
power generation.

The 2009 National Energy Strategy has been complemented by successive legal
instruments to enable investment towards its achievement:
• Law 13-09 (2009) mandated the national grid operator with facilitating the feed-in
of renewable electricity and its export to other countries.
• Act 02.09.410 founded the Société d'Investissements Énergétiques (SIE) to
manage the Energy Investment Funds and facilitate the diversification of energy
resources and the promotion of renewable energy and energy efficiency.1 SIE’s
budget is capitalised by MTEDD and the Hassan II Funds, which were created in
2000 to support social and economic development.
• Law 54-14 (2014) allows owners of capacity above 300 MW to sell electricity that
they do not self-consume to ONEE.
• Law 48-15 (2015) established a National Authority for the Regulation of the
Electricity Sector (ANRE). It also more than doubled the 2030 solar and wind
capacity targets, to 4.6 GW for solar and 4.2 GW for wind.
• Law 39-16 (2016) established the National Agency for Energy Efficiency (AMEE)
under the auspices of MTEDD, to be responsible for implementing energy
efficiency policy, including regulations, incentives and awareness campaigns.
Energy price reforms are ongoing to reduce the fiscal burden of consumer energy
subsidies. Since 2000 the government has covered the difference between fixed
energy tariffs and the cost-recovery rates. While the subsidy was one of the lowest
1 In 2023 the name of SIE was changed to Société d’Ingénierie Énergétique and given a narrow focus on investment in
energy efficiency as a “Super ESCO” (energy services company).

in North Africa and the Middle East, it still exerted pressure on the national budget
and reforms began in 2014 to partially index prices to fuel costs.
Morocco’s 2021 update of its NDC, submitted as a signatory to the Paris
Agreement, raised the renewables target to 52% of total installed electricity
capacity by 2030. This is in the context of an unconditional target to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions to 18.3% below business as usual by 2030 and a target
of 45.5% below business as usual by 2030 conditional on receiving international
assistance. Its conditional measures include reducing the emissions intensity of
the cement industry through carbon capture and storage equivalent to 2.5% of the
total reduction, or 20% of the emissions from the economically important
phosphate sector. Morocco is estimated to hold approximately 75% the world's
phosphate reserves.
Active areas of energy policy development in Morocco today include:
• Continuing to expand electricity capacity to meet growing demand.
• Strengthening energy links with Europe and sub-Saharan Africa, including through
electric interconnection projects and strategic partnerships.
• The possibility of constructing a liquefied natural gas terminal for diversifying
natural gas imports.
• Managing water stress and land degradation, which are being exacerbated by high
vulnerability to climate change, as well as energy sector resilience to climate
change.
• Managing urban air pollution.
Innovation context
Morocco has a well-developed research system relative to many of its peers in
North Africa and among emerging economies. It is currently ranked 70 out of
132 countries in the Global Innovation Index and eighth among 37 lower middle-
income countries. Within the last decade it has risen more than 20 places on this
scale, partly due to an above-average ability to convert limited inputs into impactful
outputs. One reason is its network of universities with science and engineering
research departments that have dependable government funding. The Ministry of
National Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education and Scientific
Research is responsible for policy related to fundamental and applied research in
universities and research centres. It works closely with other ministries, including
MTEDD, to promote innovation and is subject to the financial control of the Ministry
of Economy and Finance. The National Centre for Scientific and Technical
Research coordinates the research programmes of universities and scientific
institutions, and is also responsible for establishing and maintaining connections
and collaborative programmes with research institutions in foreign countries.

The country has pursued a strategy of innovation through applied R&D since 2000,
with an objective to reduce Morocco’s dependence on imported technology, move
up value chains to capture more of the added value and create a dynamic
environment for industrialisation. To this end, the Hassan-II Academy of Science
and Technology, a learned society under the responsibility of the prime minister,
has been given responsibility for setting the general orientation for scientific and
technological development, funding scientific and technical research programmes,
and integrating scientific and technical research into national and international
collaborative activities. A Permanent Inter-Ministerial Committee on Scientific
Research and Technological Development is chaired by the prime minister and
co-ordinates technology innovation activities across government, with the
contribution of MTEDD on energy topics.
The importance of two new technology-
related institutions in Morocco: MASEN and
IRESEN
The 2009 National Energy Strategy sought to position the country as a leader in
renewable technologies within Africa, in addition to setting energy security and
environmental ambitions. This clear technology-related goal distinguishes
Morocco’s renewable energy policies from those of most of its peers in lower
middle-income countries. By developing its expertise and capacity in this sector,
the country aimed to seize the opportunity to export know-how and strengthen its
economic and political ties with other nations. In addition, by positioning itself in
this way, the government viewed its renewable energy strategy as a means of
strengthening its attractiveness to foreign investors. The electricity sector in
particular needed sizeable investment to modernise and keep pace with economic
growth.
The intrinsic link between the 2009 strategy, the reduction of uncontrollable and
high fuel import bills, and the nation’s economic future created a strong alignment
with the national vision. Compared with other countries, Morocco did not have a
politically powerful incumbent fossil fuel production industry that was threatened
by the turn towards renewables and this helped build consensus. In the Moroccan
context, the public support of the king for this strategy was critical for generating
momentum behind the targets. However, given that the costs of solar and wind
technologies were at the time high compared to fossil fuels, there remained some
scepticism among the public and within government departments about the risks
of higher-than-expected economic costs.
One of the first acts in the implementation of the 2009 strategy was the creation
of two new institutions to co-ordinate and undertake projects in the renewable
energy area. It is notable that Morocco decided to use two new bodies entirely

dedicated to low-emissions energy development rather than giving responsibility
for renewables to existing entities. The two new institutions were:
• The Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN), which has responsibility
for the deployment and operation of commercial-scale technologies.
• The Institute for Research in Solar Energy and New Energies (IRESEN), which
has responsibility for technology analysis and R&D.
To bring solar electricity online on a large scale and with maximum compatibility
with the existing electricity grid, MASEN was given responsibility for developing a
CSP project and, one year after its creation, signed a power purchase agreement
with a private sector project developer from Saudi Arabia, which also provided
USD 126 million in debt and equity. The final investment decision for the initial
160 MW plant was taken quickly in 2013, with USD 800 million of financing
secured at preferential rates from international partners.2 It also secured
USD 20 million in equity from the International Finance Corporation. The finished
power station was connected to the grid in 2016, having cost Moroccan Dirham
(MAD) 7 billion (USD 855 million), just 60% of the amount appraised by the World
Bank in advance.
It has since been expanded twice with further support from international
development finance. The aggregate CSP capacity is now 510 MW, making it the
largest such plant in the world. In a 2014 assessment, the World Bank noted that
its finance was justified in the global interest because the project could potentially
contribute to halving CSP costs worldwide in the following years and because
Morocco had a preference for power generation that could be dispatched in the
evening as well as during the day.
Technology-related input to energy policy from IRESEN
is highly valued by the government
The mission of IRESEN at its founding was to fill a gap in applied research and
technological development in renewable energy in Morocco, including undertaking
pilot projects and building prototypes to test and validate technologies before
large-scale investment. It was a direct response to the needs identified in the 2009
strategy to develop internal skills and try to ensure lowest-cost technology choices.
This function was important in the context of a lower middle-income country with
high energy price sensitivity due to significant proportions of low-income
households and manufacturing in the economy. Politically, an institution with a
2 Financing partners included the World Bank. European Investment Bank, l’Agence Française de Développement, African
Development Bank, Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, the German Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation,
Building and Nuclear Safety, and the European Commission.

mandate to develop domestic capabilities and monitor the cost of renewables was
useful to gain consensus around the overall 2009 strategy.
IRESEN is under the aegis of MTEDD and, while solar electricity was the initial
priority, it has a mandate to explore technology topics relevant to all renewable
energy sources and enabling technologies. It is also responsible for collaboration
between national research institutes and engagement in relevant international
forums. It has several means of supporting R&D and technology innovation. Its
model is a hybrid between the operations of a funding agency and that of a
research institute. It has a particular focus on collaboration between researchers,
institutions and the private sector, with the objective of strengthening the overall
energy innovation ecosystem in Morocco.
As regards knowledge management at IRESEN, it manages a network of research
and innovation platforms across Morocco, equipped with state-of-the-art
laboratories to foster collaboration between academia and industry on
technologies well-suited to the national and continental context.
It has several resource push initiatives, which include the following:
• Operating a funding agency that organises competitive calls to finance R&D
projects of around USD 0.1-0.5 million at research institutions or between
universities and companies, while incorporating socio-economic factors whenever
feasible (Table 10.1). Calls have included: INNOTHERM (2012, 2013 and 2014)
for enhancing the efficiency and installation of CSP; INNOPV and INNOWIND
(2013 and 2014) for developing designs that could fit well with Morocco’s existing
electricity infrastructure; INNOBIOMASS (2014) to explore more sustainable
processes for bioenergy conversion; and INNOPROJECTS (2015) for high-
potential early-stage technologies, including energy storage and other topics.
• Operating a funding agency that organises competitive calls for collaborative
projects that take promising technologies to the stage of product development.
Calls have included: GREEN INNO-PROJECT (2018) for collaborations between
an academic partner and industrial entity on projects at or above technology
readiness level 3; and GREEN INNOBOOST 2.0 (2018) for collaborations
between a start-up, an academic partner and industrial entity on projects at or
above technology readiness level 6. GREEN INNOBOOST 2.0 is notable for the
creativity of funding design to target capital-constrained innovators who could
choose to receive the funding either as a non dilutive grant or an equity investment
from IRESEN, in addition to access to a 1.5 year programme of business services,
‑
public procurement support, connections with Moroccan experts and access to
‑
research infrastructure including the Green Energy Park. The funding can be used
for a variety of purposes: to acquire equipment, test and certify the prototype, pay
staff or buy consultancy.
• Training future engineers and project managers, and funding doctorates and post-
doctoral research.

• Establishing dedicated infrastructure for technology testing, including the Green
Energy Park and Smart Buildings Park. The Green Energy Park, a joint venture
between IRESEN and the Université Mohamed VI Polytechnique created in 2017,
includes dedicated facilities for piloting solar PV and smart grid technologies and
a laboratory environment that encourages interaction between researchers,
project developers and the private sector.
IRESEN also undertakes actions to build socio-political support. For example, it
inaugurated the Solar Decathlon Africa exhibition and competition with
Mohammed VI Polytechnic University, MTEDD and the Department of Energy. It
was held first in 2019 and raised public and policy maker awareness of the benefits
of renewable energy and sustainable construction, leading to pilot projects, the
creation of specialised research laboratories and strengthened academic
collaborations. The IRESEN research infrastructure of the Smart and Green
Building Park arose from this initiative. Projects inspired by Solar Decathlon Africa
include work on energy management systems, next-generation PV panels, phase-
change materials and energy storage. Solar Decathlon Africa boosted
international co-operation, especially within Africa.

IRESEN has provided a platform from which to explore
opportunities for hydrogen energy
Morocco has high ambitions for hydrogen energy. It has multiple co-operation
agreements with international partners to explore opportunities related to the
country’s extensive renewable resources and its proximity to export markets in
Europe. When IRESEN was established, hydrogen was not a priority topic.
However, IRESEN’s flexibility and initiative in identifying new prospects was key
to Morocco’s readiness to engage internationally as the topic gathered high-level
political interest in Europe from 2019 onwards.
IRESEN’s first formal work on hydrogen was in 2018. Its interest in the topic was
stimulated by its co-operation with Morocco’s large industrial companies, of which
the state-owned OCP Group is the biggest employer in the country. OCP Group
is active in phosphate extraction and fertiliser production, which requires it to
import large quantities of ammonia each year because Morocco does not have
sufficient access to the natural gas typically used to produce the hydrogen needed
to make ammonia. As OCP Group and IRESEN explored the opportunities for the
company to use renewable energy, the electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen
in Morocco surfaced as a potential research topic. In 2018 IRESEN and
Fraunhofer IMWS – its German research partner – directed their co-operation
towards hydrogen with a technical feasibility study of piloting ammonia production
using renewable electricity and brought it to the attention of MTEDD. The study
assessed Morocco’s potential for hydrogen production from renewable electricity
and its export.
In 2019 a National Hydrogen Commission was established, chaired by the minister
of energy and including IRESEN alongside the Ministry of Economy and Finance,
Ministry of Industry, Trade, Investment and Digital Economy, ONEE, MASEN, the
National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines, OCP Group and the National Higher
School of Mines. IRESEN was charged with developing a Green Hydrogen
Roadmap, which was published in 2021. With the technical capabilities and
national co-ordination already established by IRESEN, the development of the
roadmap did not require support from international bodies, unlike the case for
hydrogen roadmaps in some other emerging market countries, and it drew on
Moroccan perspectives only. The roadmap outlines Morocco's technical potential
for hydrogen production from renewables and a strategic pathway to installing
enough capacity by 2050 to satisfy domestic demand and establish Morocco as a
prominent export hub to Europe. The roadmap also outlined stepwise R&D and
pilot projects that would be needed for different applications of hydrogen, starting
with ammonia production.
The roadmap identified Morocco’s need to attract investment through public–
private partnerships and international co-operation. In 2021 IRESEN and the OCP

Group established GREENH2A as a platform to spearhead R&D in hydrogen and
related technologies to foster innovation.
From IRESEN’s initial exploration into hydrogen, it took just four years to achieve
full alignment with the national vision of the future. In November 2022 King
Mohammed VI announced a significant investment programme by the OCP
Group, including USD 13 billion to enhance the country's renewable energy
capabilities towards production of hydrogen and ammonia. This initiative is part of
Morocco's broader efforts to end reliance on imported ammonia, which became
much more expensive in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
The programme aims to support local industries by requiring 70% of the
components, materials and services to produce hydrogen and ammonia to be
sourced from within Morocco, creating 25 000 direct and indirect jobs and
involving 600 Moroccan companies. In 2023 King Mohammed VI announced a
further initiative called The Morocco Offer to speed up the deployment of hydrogen
technologies and create incentives for investment. Reaching these high-level
announcements was undoubtedly facilitated by the foundation that the
government had built from 2011 with the creation of IRESEN, which had the
flexibility to pursue and explore arising topics related to renewable energy.
IRESEN continues to pursue this area and has recently launched a project call
with French research institute SATT Paris-Saclay. The call is dedicated to
fostering innovation in hydrogen from renewable electricity between 2024 and
2027 by jointly supporting two to three consortia of three research partners from
both countries. It will draw upon SATT’s specific expertise in bringing the fruits of
research to market.
Battery-related R&D could lead to investment in the EV
supply chain and use of local resources
Battery R&D for high-performance lithium-ion designs was among the first projects
funded by IRESEN in 2012. The projects undertaken have tested the use of
Moroccan mineral resources (especially phosphates, of which it has the world’s
biggest resources), creating laboratory prototypes, scaling up production to semi-
pilot levels, and comparing the performance of these batteries with commercial
counterparts in solar PV systems.
As with hydrogen, electric mobility was not a priority topic when IRESEN was
created in 2011. However, as the EV market has expanded globally, there has
been dramatic market growth for lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, the type
that was researched by IRESEN and which could rely on domestic phosphate as
a raw material. These batteries may not have the same energy density as other
designs, but they have long lifespans and less reliance on mineral inputs from
countries about which there are supply chain or sustainability concerns. IRESEN’s

early work in the area of LFP batteries showed that Moroccan designs had
promising properties. This led to the OCP Group launching several initiatives,
including R&D to further enhance efficiency and durability, as well as partnerships
with international companies and research institutions. The outlook for the EV
market has strengthened – it is now projected that global sales will pass
USD 1 trillion per year by the early 2030s, with batteries representing the largest
single cost component. Consequently, IRESEN started pilot projects to explore
the feasibility of LFP battery production in Morocco, which could support a
transition to EVs for the existing producers of internal combustion engine vehicles
and components in the country. Renault, Stellantis, Sumitomo, Varroc Lighting
Systems and Valeo operate in Morocco, and Hyundai may join them. Chinese
electric carmaker BYD has been considering opening a factory in Morocco since
2017. In 2023 LG Chem, a Korean chemical company, and Hauyou Group, a
Chinese industrial company, announced an agreement to make LFP batteries in
Morocco, including conversion of imported raw lithium. This is in part because,
since 2022, Morocco’s free trade agreement with the United States makes
Moroccan-produced batteries eligible for US sales subsidies when exported to the
United States. In 2024 Chinese firm Gotion, backed by Volkswagen, confirmed
investment in another battery factory in Morocco, which could potentially use
cobalt mined in Morocco, and another Chinese firm BTR New Material announced
plans for a LFP battery component factory in Morocco.
The OCP Group plays a crucial role in Morocco's industrial development and has
recently shown interest in the production of LFP batteries due to the increasing
demand for sustainable energy solutions. This interest is driven by the abundance
of raw materials, particularly Morocco's significant phosphate reserves, a key
component of LFP batteries. The OCP Group has launched several initiatives to
enter this market, including investment in R&D to enhance the efficiency and
durability of LFP batteries, and strategic partnerships with international companies
and research institutions to leverage their expertise. Pilot projects are also
underway to test the feasibility of LFP battery production in Morocco.
IRESEN was closely involved in producing the roadmap for electric mobility in
Morocco, which outlines a plan for a charging network, charging standards,
incentives for vehicle uptake and international co-operation to learn from
experiences overseas. Alongside market pull policies, the roadmap highlights the
importance of funding R&D for technology innovation. It also proposes socio-
political support policies such as public awareness campaigns about the benefits
of EVs. In 2023 the World Bank published Unlocking Electric Mobility Potential in
the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), with a focus on Morocco and input from
IRESEN. The report broadly supports the roadmap recommendations and could
lead to further World Bank finance to tackle challenges including technical
standards, electricity sales regulation, charging station profitability and a technical
platform for integrating the various stakeholders’ data needs.

While much of the work on LFP has shifted to OCP Group-led projects (via Innovx,
an OCP Group subsidiary established for the purpose), IRESEN's R&D in the area
has focused strategically on charging technologies. This is in part because the
market in Morocco is not yet big enough to attract any of the major international
EV charging providers. The R&D has resulted in the creation of a start-up, iSmart,
to commercialise a charging station fully designed and developed by IRESEN at
the Green Energy Park. It includes technical advances in charging infrastructure.
iSmart started its first production line in 2021 and now has two production lines to
meet growing demand. The startup plays an important role in IRESEN’s Green
Miles project, which aims to identify optimal locations for these stations to
maximize their utility and accessibility. Sale of iSmart’s business could help
IRESEN reinvest in new projects in new technology areas.
IRESEN has become a strategic foundation for clean
energy knowledge and international co-operation
IRESEN initially received a budget for ten years of operation and this was
extended for an additional 6 years in 2021. This reflects the value it has created
for Morocco’s policymaking and its success in raising complementary funds.
Between 2012 and 2019 most of IRESEN's resources came from foreign donors
(57%), comprising 60% bilateral funding and 40% other foreign co-operation
agreements. The remaining 43% is from the national budget. The public grant was
mostly used towards the project calls, while the money from external fundraising
went mostly to establishing the research infrastructure.
IRESEN’s notable contributions to solar, hydrogen and electric mobility in Morocco
are all considered to be of national strategic importance for local businesses and
foreign direct investment. Its projects have led to 34 patent applications since
2017, and since IRESEN’s foundation in 2012, Morocco has built a much stronger
clean energy technology ecosystem and has proven it can react to changes in the
international technological landscape. One of the success factors has been the
co-ordination of networks of excellence through dialogue with universities and
industrialists to identify needs and challenges.
In the last few years, IRESEN has initiated international projects with governments
in Africa. The first of these is in Côte d’Ivoire. The Green Energy Park – Morocco
Côte d’Ivoire is a platform for testing solar energy technologies under semi-tropical
climatic conditions at INP-HB in Yamoussoukro, Côte d’Ivoire. It will build on the
Green Energy Park platform in Morocco and focus on the agricultural sector. As
well as calls for projects to be undertaken at GEP-MCI, it will fund students from
INP-HB and train industry professionals in the field of solar energy.
However, with the possibility that its public grant will not be fully renewed, and the
culmination of many R&D projects without commercial products, IRESEN is

exploring a new orientation to ensure its financial viability. It is developing a 2030
vision to become Africa's leading centre for applied R&D and innovation in
renewable energy by 2030. This vision foresees IRESEN organising itself around
a set of core themes aligned with national priorities and IRESEN's capabilities.
Continued government funding is likely to be essential until 2030 to realise the
vision, especially for the operational costs of infrastructure, but also to ensure
partial financial autonomy and reduce reliance on the state. Several options are
under consideration:
• Entering the business of selling services to private entities or international bodies.
New commercially oriented activities could include certifying renewable
components according to European and other standards (for example for solar PV
technologies, batteries and electrolysers), feasibility studies, detailed engineering,
site monitoring and inspection, and training. Given that the public sector is still
present in most investments in renewable energy technologies in Morocco, these
activities could also help to build essential private sector competences, help
manage excessive financing costs and foster public support. IRESEN already has
many contacts within industry that may wish to use such services.
• Generating revenue from supporting and investing in start-ups that emerge from
the IRESEN ecosystem, including the Green Energy Park. The incubation and
strategic support elements of GREEN INNOBOOST 2.0 could be expanded and
equity could be offered, either with or without direct management involvement.
• Expanding the level of support for technologies at higher technology readiness
levels, i.e. those that need specific resources to move from the laboratory to the
market. Calls for projects would continue, but with extra emphasis on the part of
the original mandate aimed at developing innovative products, services and
processes that can create jobs in Morocco in solar PV wind, bioenergy, energy
storage, hydropower, smart grids, sustainable mobility and energy efficiency. In
some cases, this could involve continued support to ideas already explored at an
early stage in the first decade of IRESEN.
• Licensing or selling intellectual property. To date, IRESEN has overseen projects
that fully own patents and projects where a consortium shares the rights. It may
be possible to raise money in future through a more strategic intellectual property
strategy.
• Continuing to diversify funding sources via international co-operation, applying to
overseas project calls and sharing some costs of R&D centres with the host
regions than benefit from them.
Findings
The experience of IRESEN reveals several insights that are relevant to the
encouragement of clean energy technology innovation in other emerging market
and developing economies.

Firstly, local know-how is highly valuable when evaluating or procuring a new
energy technology. As was discovered in Morocco for CSP, solar PV and EVs,
products and projects often need adaptation to local conditions to be smoothly
integrated with local infrastructure and the local context. IRESEN was able to play
the role of “informed consumer” and develop complementary technologies to
accelerate uptake, such as home electricity storage systems and EV chargers.3 It
is difficult for a government to support the achievement of an ambitious renewable
energy target without informed opinions and expertise among decision-makers
and in the domestic scientific community. While international partners can be very
helpful, they may not always agree with each other or may not appreciate local
nuances. Furthermore, international consultants can be very expensive.
While it may seem a bold move and requires a budget commitment, the creation
of a dedicated institution for clean energy innovation can bring significant value.
IRESEN was established at arm’s length from MTEDD with a long-term mission
to pursue technology in the interest of Morocco’s national vision for economic
development. IRESEN regularly evaluates the outcomes of its projects to inform
policy makers and relevant institutions, enabling them to improve and see the
benefits of investing in R&D.
A dedicated institution can become a focal point for a new network of researchers,
companies and experts who have common interests and can work together. This
tends to lead to expansion of this network, especially when backed by a
government agency like IRESEN and an ambitious target for energy transitions
that lends weight and credibility to the projects. The result in the case of IRESEN
has been the creation of a strong national innovation ecosystem in the space of a
decade. It can also act creatively in its design of interventions in a way that a
government ministry might not be able to – IRESEN has developed smart new
approaches to equity investment, international co-operation and research
infrastructure.
Having a strong foundation in clean energy technologies has been shown to afford
Morocco the opportunity to quickly enter new areas, such as solar, hydrogen and
electric mobility. However, the impressive developments in these areas were
conditional on IRESEN’s flexible mandate and good alignment with national
resources, including the strategic orientation of a major state-owned company
(OCP Group) and domestic resources (solar radiation and phosphate). In cases
where these capabilities align, it can be possible to rapidly develop new
co-operative R&D projects and infrastructure with the industrial sector. In
3 There is significant value in being an informed buyer of technology. The next 800 MW expansion of Morocco’s CSP power
plant, which was due to start operating in 2024, has yet to enter construction after MTEDD and ONEE rejected the proposed
technology of the supplier. With a USD 2 billion price tag, it is worth getting the technology choice right in advance.

Morocco, this was helped by the support that renewable energy investors have
given to local content and the creation of jobs and local industries.4
The case of IRESEN in Morocco demonstrates that many of the theories of
technology innovation policy that have been developed around advanced
economies apply equally as well in a lower middle-income country. Clean energy
technology development in Morocco has responded to a combination of resource
push, market pull, knowledge management and socio-political support policies.
However, in a resource-constrained context, it is shown to be particularly important
to ensure alignment with dominant national visions, foster international
partnerships and focus on technologies that do not need to be developed from
scratch, but where value can be added by adapting them in line with a clear
national strategic benefit. In the case of IRESEN, this had particular impact when
new information shifted an incumbent company towards more radical innovation
and away from incremental development of known processes where they had only
marginal international advantage. The OCP Group’s pivot to hydrogen from
renewable electricity and the potential tie-ups between Moroccan automakers and
a new battery supply chain encapsulate this dynamic.
4 At the same time, good practice on individual projects and strong technological capabilities are insufficient on their own. In
Morocco, further work is needed to ensure that smaller-scale renewable projects receive the same opportunities as utility-
scale projects, including enabling new entrants in the market and more community ownership. There remain opportunities to
improve co-ordination between the various stakeholders, political groups and ministries to reach a common vision of how
best to implement the renewable energy targets.
