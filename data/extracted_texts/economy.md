key principles of the conference outcomes, such as
equity, efficiency, and simplicity of the tax system while
ensuring greater revenue mobilization and economic

the progressivity of taxes, harmonizing rules around

to include efforts to reduce corporate tax rates while
expanding the tax base and bringing the tax rates in
