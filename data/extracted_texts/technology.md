EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Morocco has long been known as the “gateway” between Europe and Africa, due to its advantageous
geographical location at the crossroads of both seas and continents. By positioning itself as a sought-
after location for low-cost labour and international manufacturing activities, the country made
significant gains. In recent years, however – by diverging from low-value-added services and goods –
Morocco has emerged as a regional leader in the development and deployment of clean energies,
signalling a paradigm shift to a more diversified economy.
In support of this goal towards economic diversification, Morocco placed innovation and technology
creation at the heart of its economic agenda—for many years—in a strategic bid to transition from a
resource-based to a knowledge-based economy. This effort started out with the National Innovation
Strategy (2009) before its updated version: the National Strategy for the Development of Scientific
Research through 2025. Moreover, the country launched several other initiatives seeking to develop
a favourable environment for innovation, while diversifying support for research and promoting
technology transfer.
Technology transfer – as the name suggests – refers generally to the practice of transferring
technology in its various subtypes, from the originating party to the benefitting party. Furthermore,
technology transfer can take several forms; it is called either inward or outward technology transfer
when technology is transferred into the entity – or transferred out to another party, respectively.
Similarly, ‘intra’ or ‘inter’ technology transfer refers to when the technology is transferred to entities
within the same group, or entities not belonging to the same group. In such cases, entities are usually
research institutions (universities or research centres), firms, or both.
With this context in mind, technology transfer in Morocco exists in its various forms, with the current
dominating narrative suggesting a more focused effort on the university-industry nexus. Indeed, a
culminative set of initiatives were taken over the years in a bid to forge links between university and
industry. Cities of innovation were created within universities in five regions, with more to follow,
and a sizable number of funding initiatives to support innovative projects and start-ups were
launched. In February 2022, a National Plan for the Acceleration and Transformation of the Higher
Education, Scientific Research and Innovation (ESRI) ecosystem was announced, to work in alignment
with the New Development Model of 2021. The plan aims to propel the country along a progressive
path forward, with strong innovative capacity and high added value across both academia and
science, by overhauling Moroccan universities and improving the financial flow into research and
innovation.
Similar to universities, firms are guaranteed to use some form of technology transfer on a daily basis.
The limited empirical data on the technology transfer activities at the firm level in Morocco, renders
a detailed national assessment and diagnosis challenging. However, in accordance with the general
observation that firms in developing countries are more likely be importers of technology than
exporters, it can be assumed that inward technology transfer is the most predominant form in
Morocco. While there may be exceptions, the lack of supportive examples makes outward
technology transfers unlikely to hold significant weight in the country’s technology transfer
ecosystem. Overall, technology-based innovation in Morocco is characterised by using a market-pull
rather than technology-push strategy. Indeed, Morocco’s most structured and successful technology
transfer value chains are found predominately in the mining, phosphate, agronomy, and renewable
energies sectors, due to their significance to the national economy.
As reported by several studies, significant progress has been made, backed and confirmed by
statistics including the number of international publications, patents filed, and start-ups created.
However, several gains are short-lived rather than being sustainable in the long run, and the
7

--- Page 9 ---

technology transfer ecosystem remains riddled with challenges, some more complex than others. At
university and public research institutions, bridging the “valley of death” is of particular interest. This
entails commercialising and promoting research outputs, which is a growing pain not only due to a
lack of resources, but also because researchers’ understanding of the commercial value of their work
is inadequate. The lack of absorption capacity from industry, compounded by the difference in
culture between academia and their respective industries, appears to be a crucial factor as well.
At the firm-level, challenges are abundant. Taking the automotive industry as an example, the
benefits of offshoring for Morocco are numerous, but perhaps the biggest challenge and
consequential opportunity lies in the inclusion of local firms in the value chain, which would ensure a
seamless technology transfer. Such a challenge becomes more pronounced when labour-intensive
offshoring activities limit higher value-added creation and meaningful training and technology
transfer. From an investor’s perspective, technology transfer activities should be restricted to a
certain extent, in order to preserve their competitive advantage. This would result in a balancing act
where Morocco must both seize opportunities to foster the country’s industrialisation, while
ensuring technology transfer is occurring through targeted policies and technical assistance to local
firms.

1.TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER IN
MOROCCO- AN OVERVIEW
Morocco has been making real efforts in advancing science, technology, and innovation for over two
decades now. The country has strived to make its STI ecosystem more interconnected by forging
links between the private and public sector. A few key statistics can describe the STI status in
Morocco: Morocco ranked 77th in the 2021 Global Innovation Index, R&D financing represents less
than 1% of its GDP, and SCImago ranks Morocco 6th in Africa in terms of scientific publications.
Countries with a robust track record in STI generally display the following characteristics:
outstanding universities, a higher proportion of population with a higher degree, developed financial
support and venture capital, developed university-industry links, an enticing environment for
innovation through innovation-friendly regulations and policies, proactive policies and incentives to
attract talent, and an overall favourable environment to do business. To this end, Morocco made
notable progress in all these sectors through a series of continuous and progressive reforms and
initiatives.
Technology transfer is a highly collaborative and interactive process, where various actors such as
research institutions, firms, incubators, accelerators, and civil society work in synergy with each
other. Technology transfer activities are conducted in Morocco in various forms but two particular
observations were at the forefront of this study: firstly, national debate appears to focus mainly on
university-industry collaboration, inadvertently discounting the potential that local firms hold, and
secondly, R&D activities are clustered in only a few cities, putting other regions at risk of being
excluded in the country’s innovation and industrialisation efforts.

1.1 Science, technology and innovation: State of play
The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) ranked Morocco 77th out of 132 economies
featured in its 2021 Global Innovation Index (GII) report;1 the GII ranks world economies according to
their capabilities for innovation. In accordance with the report, Morocco performed well in
innovation outputs, specifically knowledge and technology, but fell short on other metrics such as
human capital and research.
For many years, Morocco has expressed its ambition to become a frontrunner in the region in the
areas of science, technology, and innovation. Unveiled in spring 2021, the country’s New
Development Model2 laid out the steps the government will take to make Morocco a nation of
opportunity, entrepreneurship, and innovation. Specific emphasis was placed on the importance of
universities’ role in building a future-ready “skilled Morocco”. A supportive infrastructure is as
necessary to create a conducive STI environment as the case of human capital development.
Morocco is undoubtedly achieving its plans to improve digital infrastructure. As of January 2021, at
least 27.62 million Moroccans (nearly 74% of the population) use the internet, a significant increase
from the 25.32 million registered in the same month of the preceding year,3 thus making Morocco
the most advanced market in Africa where internet connectivity is concerned. In 2021, Morocco was
ranked 84th globally and 6th in Africa based on the Digital Quality Index (DQI), which measures digital
quality in 110 countries based on five criteria: internet affordability, internet quality, electronic
infrastructure, electronic security, and electronic government. Similarly, Morocco ranks the 45th
country out of 230 countries globally in mobile data affordability.4
Cognizant of the role of digital infrastructure in promoting Industry 4.0, the country launched the
Agency of Digital Development (ADD) – a strategic public entity placed under the supervision of the
ministry in charge of the Digital Economy. The ADD’s primary mandate is to act as a digital
transformation catalyst, by overseeing the country’s digital development strategy and promoting the
shift to digital tools across all sectors.
The ADD certainly lived up to its mission in May 2019, when it launched the AL-KHAWARIZMI
program. Endowed with a budget of 50 million Moroccan dirhams ($5.6 million), the program aims to
promote research and development in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its application through calls for
proposed research. The future of AI cannot be underestimated, and it is instructive to note that
Morocco has an active AI research community. For instance, MoroccoAI – a network of Moroccan AI
experts – seeks to expand Morocco’s AI transformation and promote AI education and research.
Similarly, AI Movement, also known as the Moroccan International Centre for Artificial Intelligence, is
a centre of excellence of Artificial Intelligence established at Mohammed VI Polytechnique University
(UM6P) that aims to foster the emergence of Moroccan expertise in Artificial Intelligence and Data
Sciences.
Several studies have extensively examined the STI activity in the country, and it is safe to say that
Morocco is paving the way for Industry 4.0. As of Q3 2019, the country boasts 31 Tech Hubs, placing
it second in North Africa.5
1.2 Technology Transfer definition
Technology transfer is a practice that has generated much discourse over the years, and even more
recently in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, owing to vaccine access and equity. However, the
debate began much earlier in 1961 at the 1084th plenary meeting, when some developing countries
requested the Secretary General to commission a study examining the effects of patents, and its
legislations in selected under-developed countries. The request also sought to inspect issues
surrounding the granting, protection, and use of patents, considering the provisions of existing
international conventions and the special needs of developing countries.6 It subsequently became
one of the most discussed areas in the international economic spheres, leading to a range of policies,
frameworks, and partnerships at the national, regional, and international levels.
10

--- Page 12 ---

The definition of technology transfer has evolved over the years, varying from one stakeholder to
another. For instance, Tech Transfer Central defines technology transfer (or Tech Transfer) in the
context of research institutions, as “the process by which new inventions and innovations created in
those institutions’ labs are translated into products and commercialized.”7 The European Commission
defines it as “The process of conveying results stemming from scientific and technological research to
the market and to wider society, along with associated skills and procedures, and is such an intrinsic
part of the technological innovation process.”8 MIT describes technology transfer as “The movement
of knowledge and discoveries to the general public. It can occur through publications, graduating
students entering the workforce, presentations at conferences, and research relationships with
industry.”9 NASA presents its technology transfer practice as “A programme that ensures that
innovations developed for exploration and discovery are broadly available to the public, maximising
the benefit to the nation.”10
In our day-to-day life, there are numerous examples of technology transfer around us. For instance,
one of the most notable inventions of 2000s was the smartphone, which has since become the sine
qua non, of modern society. When it was first unveiled by Steve Jobs in 2007, the iPhone made global
headlines. However, its invention is not as simple as it may appear. Indeed, the device had six layers,
and each one was the result of painstaking research.11 Another example is Amazon — the ever
popular e-commerce website which started as an online bookstore in 1994, and then expanded into
other industries such as consumer electronics, cloud computing and entertainment, before becoming
one of the world’s most valuable companies12 and claiming the third spot in the list of the most
innovative companies in the world in 2021.13 The company would later lend its platform to other
businesses to sell their products. During this time, it also began offering several businesses the
possibility to outsource their computing needs, so that they could sell their own products on Amazon
in exchange for a fee which would later lay the foundation of Amazon Web Services (AWS).
These examples demonstrate the true power and potential of technology transfer, and the far
reaching economic and societal benefits that can be harnessed in its application. Amazon ushered in
the cloud era, while Apple revolutionized the mobile industry.
With the impacts of technology transfer being so potent and profound, it should be emphasised that
the process is more complex and cumbersome than it appears. The practice involves various
stakeholders, processes, and factors — both scientific and non-scientific — in an overall, detailed
process that is gradual and cumulative (see figure 1).

1.3 Intellectual Property in Morocco
In its general set up, technology transfer refers to the process of sharing intellectual property in its
various forms with both wider society and individual economic actors. Therefore, protecting
inventions originating from universities, research institutions (public or private), firms, and
entrepreneurs is integral step to the technology transfer value chain. IP protection offers many
benefits, namely helping patent holders to explore different avenues to commercialise their IP by
either developing, manufacturing and turning it into a source of revenue, or by licensing or
franchising it. It also serves to protect the innovator’s product by restricting access to it.
Furthermore, it increases chances of cross-border collaboration and allows the exporting of products
and services (outward technology transfer).
It is, however, necessary to note that if IP captures an important part in the technology transfer value
chain, it is a double-edge sword. Indeed, while weak IPR protection may disincentivise research
endeavours and lead to the unintentional spill over of sensitive data by the invention’s holder, a
strong IPR protection – on the other hand – could lead to insufficient knowledge and technology
diffusion, thereby slowing innovation. Thus, it is important to strike the right balance whereby
innovation is promoted, and the patent holder’s rights are upheld.
In Morocco, The Moroccan Office of Industrial and Commercial Property (OMPIC) is the entity
responsible for the protection and promotion of intellectual property. Founded in 2006 and
headquartered in the port city of Casablanca with multiple branches across the country, OMPIC is a
12

--- Page 14 ---

public institution with legal status and financial autonomy under the overall supervision of the
Ministry of Industry, Trade, Investment, and the Digital Economy.
According to OMPIC’s official figures, patent filing in Morocco grew by 167% during the period 2015-
2019 with patents of Moroccan origin representing only 7% of the total number (see figure 2).

The patents of foreign origin, on the other hand, grew by 218% over the same period. Perhaps most
notably, these statistics are derived directly from the EPO-Morocco validation agreement of
European patents in Morocco – effected on March 1st, 2015 – with the chief aim to open Morocco to
global markets and therefore strengthen its economic integration. Indeed, the agreement resulted in
more simplicity in the process of patents filing for Europeans in particular.
While this result bolstered Morocco’s position in the patenting market, there was a decrease in the
number of native Moroccans filing between 2015 and 2017 which can be attributed to Law 23-1314
that was introduced in December 2014. The objective of this law was to modernise and reform the
patent filing system, giving it superior alignment with international standards while improving the
quality of patents filed. This was made possible by introducing a set of criteria to selectively attract
productive investments with high added value thereby reducing counterfeits in the process.
In accordance with OMPIC official figures, the top countries for patent filing during the
aforementioned period (2014-2019) have steadily been the United States, France, Germany and Italy
respectively, with new countries that do not commonly file patents in Morocco—such as Turkey,
China, and Denmark – following suit. It is also worth noting that whilst pharmaceutical groups have
consistently been among the top in the list of patent applicants, they are slowly capitulating to
companies in the automotive sector. In 2019, there were four groups active in the automotive sector
that were in the top 10 list of applicants (see figure 3), putting Morocco on course to become the
leading African automaker – a title currently credited to South Africa.

Figure 3: Top patent applicants 2016-2019

A number of reforms to fine-tune the patent filing and protection system, have enabled Morocco to
achieve international praise. In its annually released IP Index, The US Chamber of Commerce Global
Innovation Policy Centre (GIPC) ranked Morocco 22nd out of 53 countries15 and following this,
became the highest performing middle-income economy in the index. The index evaluates IP rights in
53 global economies, from patent and copyright policies to commercialization of IP assets,
enforcement, and ratification of International Treaties. The report describes Morocco as having
strong protection for patents and related rights — a position that stemmed mainly from the US-
Morocco Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and agreements with the EU that have encouraged the country
to strengthen its IP environment and associated standards.
Despite this vantage ranking, Morocco’s IP environment remains rife with obstacles, mainly around
counterfeit. In a recent publication by the OECD, Morocco ranked 16th out of the 25 top provenance
countries in counterfeit and pirated goods between 2017-201916, topping the list of African
countries. Another report by the OECD and the EU’s Intellectual Property Office, found that the
proliferation of free trade zones is unintentionally boosting counterfeiting as a direct result of the
reduced taxes, customs controls, light regulation, and limited oversight.17
With heightened vigilance towards these issues, and to meet its international commitments in the
fight against counterfeiting and piracy, the country has taken several initiatives such as introducing
financial penalties, strengthening border controls, and raising consumer awareness of the dangers of
counterfeit products. In recognition of Morocco’s efforts in the development of a system of
intellectual property that promotes innovation, creativity, and fights counterfeiting – Morocco was
unanimously elected in October 2019, as a chair of the World Intellectual Property Organisation
(WIPO) General Assembly for the biennium 2020/2021. It has thus become the first Arab country and
14

--- Page 16 ---

the second African country after Nigeria, to preside the General Assembly of the WIPO since its
creation in 1967.18
1.4 Morocco’s Technology Transfer Communities
1.4.1 Universities
Morocco is home to 12 public universities and several private institutions. Private institutions do not
play a significant role in technology transfer, unlike public universities. Amongst the most active
universities in research and development are the University of Cady Ayyad in Marrakech,
Mohammed I University of Oujda, and the Mohammed VI Polytechnique University (UM6P).
▪ University Cady Ayyad (UCA)- Marrakesh
Founded in 1978, University Cady Ayyad has 15 affiliate institutions, 67 labs and 3 research centres
across the cities of Marrakesh, Kelaat Sraghna, Safi and Essaouira. Like other universities, UCA’s
research activities revolve around the thematic areas relevant to the Marrakech-Safi region’s socio-
economic needs and challenges. In line with its objective to play an active role in its socio-economic
and cultural surroundings and strengthen the links between public institutions and elected councils,
UCA, in December 2021, signed an agreement with the city council of Marrakech. The agreement
provides for the city’s local development through actions such as preparing the city action plan for
the period 2022-2027 and helping the city of Marrakesh develop its application to UNESCO to join
the network of learning cities. 19 UCA was the first Moroccan university to launch a MOOC in 2013.
▪ Mohammed I University Oujda (UMP)
The Mohammed I University of Oujda is a public university located in the eastern region of Morocco,
known as the ‘Oriental region.’ Founded in 1978, it federates 10 higher education institutions, 5
faculties, and 3 specialized schools spread over three cities in the region: Oujda, Nador, and Al-
Hoceima. The university focuses on research and the development of the Oriental region through
various structures and initiatives aimed at bringing the university closer to its socio-economic
environment. The Scimago Institutions ranked UMP as the top Moroccan university in research and
innovation in 2021.20This ranking was based on scientific research, innovation, societal impact, and
other sub-criteria such as the number of studies published on the Scopus database.
UMP is home to a large technology transfer facility named the “Technology Transfer and Expertise”
campus (CU2TE) which spreads over a surface of four hectares with several research laboratories,
incubators, and firms, thus enabling cross-fertilization of efforts. The CU2TE also serves as a platform
for South-South cooperation and a hub for technology transfer between African countries.
▪ University Mohammed VI Polytechnique (UM6P)
Located in the Mohammed VI Green City, UM6P has steadily become the leading Moroccan
institution in applied research and innovation since its official inauguration in 2017; focusing not only
on areas of interest to the Moroccan economy such as renewable energies, mining, and agriculture
but also on Africa as a whole.
Since its inauguration, the university has forged partnerships with the distinguished universities
Columbia Business School, MIT, and McGill University. UM6P’s ultimate goal is to become an African
centre of excellence to propel the continent into new frontiers of business and human development,
and they have already made a significant start by housing Africa’s most powerful supercomputer
with the support of the University of Cambridge, Dell and Intel.21 UM6P’s programs are designed
around Africa’s top priority areas known as the High 5s: light up and power Africa, feed, industrialize,
integrate, and improve the quality of life for the people of Africa.22 To date, there have been
seventeen research labs dedicated to those areas.
15

--- Page 17 ---

UM6P has a Technology Transfer Office (TTO) mandated to manage the transfer of technology,
protect, promote and valorise the intellectual property developed in the university’s labs. This
includes ensuring a successful transfer of invention and discovery to industry. For that purpose, the
TTO is equipped with two platforms:
- The TechCell: A platform for accelerated transfer of chemical technologies and processes having
a maturity level superior to TRL3.

sector.
Overall, universities remain the top Moroccan patent applicants at both the national and
international level.23 Three Moroccan universities in particular are among the PCT top applicants (see
table below). The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) is a system that assists applicants in securing
international patent protection for their inventions.

Despite universities registering the highest number of filed patents, their inventions are rarely
commercialised. The most notable examples of Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) in the country
were highlighted in this section, but such structures remain scarce. However, foundations were laid
in the first quarter of 2022 to set up TTOs in a number of Moroccan universities with the support of
OMPIC which will assist in defining the business and governance model of developed structures.
1.4.2 Research Centres
There are several research centres in Morocco. Some are embedded in universities, while others are
standalone research centres belonging to ministries, government agencies, and corporations.
Research activities are focussed on sectors of priority such as mining, renewable energies, agronomy,
phosphate, and digital technologies.
An example of one of these centres is the Institute for Research into Solar and New Energies
(IRESEN). Created in 2011, IRESEN is responsible for identifying research priorities and projects
aligned with the country’s national energy policy objectives. It also operates both as a funding agency
that organizes competitive calls for R&D and innovation projects, and a research organization that
16

--- Page 18 ---

sets up applied R&D platforms to access to research and innovation infrastructure, such as the Green
Energy Park and Smart Buildings Park.
IRESEN is a strategic entity that plays a significant role in the energy mix strategy in Morocco, and is
present throughout the green energy value chain via two fronts:
- Infrastructure: Through a network of research platforms dedicated to green energy.
- Support entity: By financing research projects, providing access to expertise, administrative and
logistical support for equipment acquisition, supporting scientific conferences participation,
offering grants and scholarships to PhD students.
The institute includes a network of six platforms focused on research and innovation in clean energy:
- Green Energy Park: A test, research, and learning platform focused on solar energy. The initiative
is a collaboration between IRESEN and UM6P.
- Agro energy TIC valley: A platform dedicated to research and development in bioenergy, agri-
tech, and the food-water-energy nexus with a focus on introducing renewable energies in the
agricultural and agri-food sectors by exploiting advancements in digital technology.
- Water energy nexus: A platform dedicated to research and development in marine energy, water
treatment and desalination.
- Green and Smart building Park: A learning, research, and test platform focused on green
buildings, energy efficiency, and smart network fields.
- GEP-Maroc Cote D’Ivoire (GEPMCI): A collaboration with l'Institut National Polytechnique Félix
Houphouët Boigny (INP-HB) in Yamoussoukro, Côte d'Ivoire. The platform complements the
Green Energy Park by integrating solar thermic and photovoltaic energies.
- Green H2A: A Green hydrogen & applications park and a research platform focused on the
industrial deployment of green hydrogen applications in Morocco.
IRESEN has a network of 14 labs across the country hosted by various Moroccan universities, three of
which can be found at the University of Cady Ayyad: the production of thermic energy lab, the
electric mobility lab, and the batteries testing lab. Several public entities chair IRESEN, including the
Ministries of Economy and Finance, Higher Education, Research and Innovation, and the Energy
Transition and Sustainable Development ministry, reiterating the strategic value of the institute to
Morocco’s commitment to green energy.
1.4.3 Incubators
Incubation in Morocco started at the beginning of the year 2000, specifically in universities prompted
by Law 01/00 regarding the organisation of higher education. The law mandated universities to
create incubators to support innovative start-ups.24
Incubators are structures that support entrepreneurs in building their young companies through a
range of services such as physical infrastructure, mentorship, access to financing, and extended
networking opportunities.
To meet the needs of the start-ups in Morocco, several incubators were launched by both the private
and public sectors. Examples of incubators in Morocco include: the U-Founders incubator by the
UM6P, Impact Lab, Technopark incubator Casablanca, and Al Akhawayn university incubator. It is
worth noting that private incubators are important in the innovation ecosystem in Morocco, playing
a pivotal role in supporting start-ups. However, it cannot be said with confidence whether they are
significant in the technology transfer value chain.
17

The university of Hassan 1st of Settat, which houses of one the country’s largest incubators, offers a
framework in which patents are commercialised. As part of this framework, the university’s PhD
students are offered the opportunity to develop and commercialise their patents with the financial,
technical, and administrative support of the incubator. As of 2022, seven successful start-ups
emerged as a result of this incubation model:
Company name Description Number of patents

Morocco incubation and Spin-off Network (RMIE) is the initiative of reference when it comes to
incubators in Morocco. Indeed, RMIE supports the setup, development and promotion of university
incubators. As of 2019, seventeen university incubators are members of the RMIE—only five of
whom are actually operational.25 This low figure is due to a number of factors such as lack of financial
and industrial support, and the ambiguity surrounding the legal status of start-ups.
1.4.4 Firms
According to a 2019 study by the Moroccan Higher Planning Commission26, firms in Morocco are
clustered in the cities of Casablanca and Tangiers which jointly host 63% of the total number of
companies in Morocco. MSMEs represent 93% of firms in the country, with two thirds operating in
the tertiary sector and less than 10% in the industrial sector. The industrial export sector is
substantially dominated by large companies, who account for 60% of the sector’s exports.
There are no exact figures on the number of multinational companies in Morocco, however, IT,
pharmaceuticals, automotive, and aerospace heavy weights including IBM, Microsoft, Intel, Dell,
Roche, Renault, Safran, Airbus, and Boeing operate through subsidiaries and joint ventures with local
companies.
There are a number of entities that ensure favourable conditions for business and development are
provided, and promote capacity building programmes for the private sector. Examples of these
entities include:
- Confederation Generale des Entreprises au Maroc (CGEM) : Created in 1947 and
headquartered in Casablanca, the General Confederation of Moroccan enterprises is the
main representative of enterprises in the country, counting over 90 000 member
companies27, and serves as an intermediary between the private sector and the public sector
18

--- Page 20 ---

and institutional organisations. It regularly commissions and finances studies to better inform
the direction and efficacity of national policies and promotes research and innovation by
exploring and leveraging collaboration between firms and universities.
- Le Groupement des Industries Marocaines Aeronautiques et Spatiales (GIMAS) : Founded in
the early years of 2000 and headquartered in Casablanca, The Group of Moroccan
Aeronautic and Special Industries (GIMAS) counted 125 members in 2019.28 Among its
objectives is to consolidate and reinforce the competitivity of the aerospace Moroccan
industry, represent the best interests of the industry with national and international
organisms, and ensure the integration of an R&D in the national aerospace strategy through
partnerships with universities and research centres.
- La Fédération des Industries Métallurgiques, Mécaniques et Electromécaniques (FIMME) :
Founded in 1951 and headquartered in Casablanca, the Federation of Metallurgics,
Mecanics, and Electromecanics (FIMME) has 1600 members.29 Among its top priorities is to
develop the technological capacities of its members through collective capacity building
programmes and source development opportunities from abroad.
To accelerate national innovation, Morocco has increased its efforts to facilitate the creation of start-
ups through the introduction of various financing and support mechanisms:
- Innov Invest fund: launched in 2017, this programme was a critical turning point for
entrepreneurs in Morocco. It was established by Morocco Guarantee and SME Finance Corp
(CCG) and supported by the Moroccan Government, the World Bank, and the European
Union to enhance the access to finance for SMEs and start-ups, and make Morocco a regional
hub for innovative entrepreneurs. 30 As of 2020, about 200 projects benefited from funding,
totalling a sum of 100 million dirhams (about $1million). 31
- Innov’Act programme: A programme launched by MESRSI and R&D Maroc (Moroccan
Association for R&D) to promote the activities of R&D and dynamize innovation in the
national production sector.
- Programme INTILAK: This programme is dedicated to innovative start-ups having at least two
years of activity in an innovative project or R&D promotion. The programme finances up to
90% of the expenses of the project, not exceeding one million Moroccan dirhams (about
$100,800.00).
- The Moroccan Innovation and Spin-off Network (RMIE): Founded in 2002, RMIE is managed
by CNRST and aims to promote innovation, start-ups creation, and the transfer of knowledge
between university and industry.
- Maroc Numeric Fund (MNF): Launched in 2010, the MNF is a venture capital fund
focused primarily on tech start-ups. It is a public-private investment fund whose leading
investors are: AttijariWafa bank, Banque Centrale Populaire, BMCE bank, Morocco
Information Technology Company (MITC) which is the management company of Moroccan
Technoparks, and Central Guarantee Fund (CDG).
- Programme Tatwir: This programme offers a customised blended and integrated
offer of investment, innovation support, and technical advisory. It specifically targets MSMEs
actives in the sectors of green growth, industrial innovation and Industry 4.0. Three
programmes are offered: Tatwir green growth, Tatwir start-ups, Tatwir automotive
integration.
- PTR instrument: The PTR instrument is dedicated to projects of innovation and technological
development undertaken by firms, consortiums or groups of enterprises and covers the
expenses of such projects up to 75% not exceeding 100 000 dirhams ($10,000).

1.4.5 Civil Society
In national innovation systems, the role of civil society tends to be underestimated and, in some
instances, overlooked, especially in developing countries where government is seen as the main
catalyst for change. In the context of technology transfer in Africa, civil society is mostly seen as a
contributor at the grassroot level through sensitization and capacity building activities.
In Morocco, civil society has had a small place in the national innovation system for over two
decades. Its main role is to promote innovation and R&D, and serve as an interface between
government, industry, and society to ensure a continuous collaboration and exchange of ideas
among the actors of the national innovation ecosystem. Three particular entities stand out:
▪ The Moroccan Association for Research & Development (AMDRS): Created in 2013 to
promote, support, develop and commercialise scientific research in Morocco. Some note-
worthy examples of the activities of the AMDRS include the creation of the African Prize for
the best scientific article on solutions for health problems in Africa in 2018, and the
organization of a training course on how to write scientific articles in 2019.
▪ INJAZ al Maghrib : Created in 2007, INJAZ al Maghrib is a non-profit organization that
connects Moroccan youth to the private sector, with the end goal of creating a generation of
future entrepreneurs. The organization champions the “learning by doing” approach by
mobilizing its extended network of volunteers of business executives to deliver customized
programs in a number of Moroccan institutions.
▪ Moroccan Centre for Innovation and Social Entrepreneurship (MCISE): Founded in 2012 by a
group of social change enthusiasts, the centre is a not-for-profit organization whose mission
is to find innovative solutions to social problems in Morocco through the support and
mentoring of local social entrepreneurs. The MCISE has a strong presence in the social
entrepreneurship ecosystem in Morocco, and strong international ties which led to the
centre becoming a fellow of the prestigious Ashoka network in 2017.
1.5 Institutional arrangement and governance
Despite having no single, unified strategy for science, technology, and innovation, Morocco has three
different plans32 that contain elements of an STI strategy: the Morocco Innovation Initiative, the
Moroccan National Strategy for the Development of Scientific Research through 2025, and the
Moroccan Vision for Education 2015-2030, all of which are designed to work in tandem around the
country’s scientific and technological research priorities:
- Health, environment, and quality of life
- Agriculture, fishing, and water
- Natural resources and renewable energies
- Aeronautic and automobile industry, transport, logistics, and advanced technologies
- Education and learning
- Human sciences and contemporary challenges of the Moroccan society
Research institutions in Morocco are under the responsibility of the state with the exception of a few
private institutions. Several entities and bodies are involved in the development and priority setting
of STI R&D policies in the country, including legislation, evaluation, and funding:
- The Supreme Council for Education, Training, and Scientific Research (CSEFRS) is an
independent and consultative body instituted through Article 168 of the constitution. Its
primary purpose is advocating on all matters relevant to education, training, and research. It
brings together a large group of expert stakeholders from government institutions, civil
20

--- Page 22 ---

society, and teachers’ unions to discuss and participate in efforts relating to education,
training, and research.
- The Permanent Inter-Ministerial Committee on Scientific Research and Technological
Development (CPIRSDT) is chaired by the Prime Minister, and its mission is to coordinate R&D
activities across government. It is supported by the CSEFRS.
- The Hassan-II Academy of Science and Technology is also under the responsibility of the
Prime Minister, and contributes to the promotion of scientific research, sets the general
orientations for scientific and technological development, funds scientific and technical
research programs, evaluates research programs, and oversees the integration of scientific
and technical research in national and international collaborative activities and socio-
economic development. Its capacity to mobilize the national and international scientific
communities, coupled with its financial standing, funding, and institutional positioning,
makes the institution important in the orientation and promotion of scientific research
activities.
- The National Centre for Scientific and Technical Research (CNRST) coordinates research
programs among universities and scientific institutions. CNRST is also responsible for
establishing and maintaining connections and collaborative programs with research
institutions in foreign countries.
- The National Agency for the Evaluation and Quality Assurance of Higher Education and
Scientific Research (ANEAQ) was created pursuant to Law 01.00 on higher education
organization and its reform. Its main objective is to improve and ensure the quality,
competitiveness, and diversity of training, promote scientific research, and adapt the
educational system to suit the market’s needs.
The figure below illustrates the key players in the Moroccan technology transfer ecosystem; their
functions, and their collaborative and hierarchical relationships.

--- Page 23 ---

It should be noted that the role of certain entities is evolving. For instance, OMPIC is set to play a
more significant role in the commercialisation of research products. In 2022, it signed several
agreements with Moroccan universities to help establish their technology transfer offices.
1.6 R&D funding
In 2017, Morocco invested 0.8% of its GDP in R&D, a considerable increase from the 0.34% spent in
2016, but still low compared to the 2.3% recorded in OECD countries. 33
The latest available statistics on budgetary allocation among entities involved in R&D put institutions
of higher education as the top receivers accounting for about 45% of the total budget, followed by
public research institutions with 23%, with the remainder allocated to the private sector and
international co-operation (see figure 5). These numbers reiterate Morocco’s focus on universities to
play a greater role in the technology transfer ecosystem.
Firms on the other hand, allocate significantly less funds to R&D activities. According to the
Moroccan Higher Planning Commission,34 only 6% of Moroccan firms engaged in R&D activities in
2019, with that sample being primarily large companies. It has also been noted that companies that
don’t invest in R&D activities cite lack of financial resources as the main obstacle.

bataille de la compétitivité, 2012.
Given the high number of institutions involved in R&D, it would be assumed that there is a specific
entity in charge of R&D overall financing in the country. However, it appears that there is no single
body which allocates these fundings. In fact, several funds are emerging to support research in
priority sectors to the country, such as mining, agriculture, and clean energy. These funds are
administered through tenders or open calls for research and innovation in thematic areas of interest
to the funding entity.
22

--- Page 24 ---

It is important to note that despite the number of R&D funding initiatives launched by various
entities in the country, CNRST remains the only entity, in line with its mission of being a dynamic
actor and R&D facilitator, involved in most initiatives either in the implementation, evaluation, or
follow-up stages.

2.TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER
SECTORAL ACTIVITIES
Technology transfer in Morocco takes various forms with inward technology transfer being the
most dominant.
At the research institution-level, several bi-lateral and multilateral agreements were signed to open
Moroccan universities to the world and ensure a continuous flow of knowledge exchange, and to
strengthen Moroccan capabilities in sectors of priority. Prominent research centres, such as IRESEN
and OCP’s R&D centres and their subsidiaries, have multiplied their presence in recent years in a
number of Moroccan universities in a bid to accelerate bilateral exchange of knowledge. UM6P
plays particularly an important role in the national technology transfer system.
At the firm-level, the high number of multinational companies operating in the country, coupled
with low R&D expenditure by Moroccan companies that are primarily MSMEs, strongly suggests
that technology transfer activities are led by multinationals’ subsidiaries and joint ventures between
foreign and local companies.
While sufficient data on detailed technology transfer collaborations between firms in Morocco is
overall lacking, it is widely understood that the most structured and successful technology transfer
value chains in the country are found in the fields of mining, phosphate, agronomy and renewable
energies.
24

--- Page 26 ---

2.1 Renewable energies
As environmental concerns continue to rise, Morocco has pledged 80% renewable energy use by
2050.35 In line with its vision to achieve a greener economy by 2030, Morocco expanded efforts to
mobilise local stakeholders and engage with external partners through numerous partnerships. As an
example, Morocco stepped up efforts to establish an Electric Vehicle (EV) industry through a
technology transfer agreement with Brazil in August 202136, an established Moroccan trading
partner. The partnership is a joint effort between INESC P&D Brazil, a non-governmental scientific
and technological institution, GEP, Morocco’s Green Energy Park research platform, and the Office
Cherifien of Phosphate (OCP) Group. Under the agreement, researchers in Brazil will develop the
technology, while the Moroccan government will provide funding for the research. The researchers
will develop a prototype of the charging equipment in Brazil, and a “twin” will be created in Morocco.
In March 2022, Morocco signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Bahrain, to
strengthen bilateral cooperation in the sector of renewable energy.37 The goal of the agreement is to
mobilise and enhance each side’s expertise and resources to achieve the common goals of
development and renewable energies commitments. The focus of the two partners will be on solar
energy projects, the development of storage technology and automation, as well as programs to
strengthen skills with dedicated training activities and workshops. Similarly, in May 2022, Morocco
and Saudi Arabia signed a MoU on the peaceful use of atomic energy. The agreement aims to bring
the expertise of the two countries in the field specifically as it pertains to designing, constructing, and
operating of a nuclear fuel cycle and waste management. This also includes the areas of engineering
and marketing innovative techniques for new generations of nuclear plants.38
Another noteworthy example of technology transfer in the energy sector is that of the International
University of Rabat (UIR)—a semi-public university. With an average of 40 patents filed annually, the
majority of its inventions aim to bring about innovation in the sectors of energy, transport and
metrology. To date, the university has transferred four inventions39 to the energy industry:
- An autonomous solar generator for schools in remote areas.
- A cylindric parabolic solar collector which was transferred to a local company called Taqa
pro, a specialist in photovoltaic solar installation.
- A vacuum tube sensor operating at atmospheric pressure.
- A system of heating bitumen storage by high-energy solar panel.
It is unclear whether these inventions were transferred to national or foreign entities, however UIR
remains one of the few Moroccan universities focused on technology transfer activities.
2.2 Agriculture
Moroccan society depends a great deal on agriculture. In 2020, the agricultural sector accounted for
about 11.7% of Morocco’s GDP, behind only the industrial (26.1%) and services (50.8%) sectors.40
Agriculture is often referred to as a priority sector in Morocco’s development plans. This is partly
because of its importance to the national economy. However, it is also because of the pressure
Morocco faces to improve efficiency and increase production so that it is better able to cope with the
serious challenges posed by both demographic growth and climate change.
The agricultural sector in Morocco has historically relied on traditional practices and skills. However,
innovations in pesticides, fertilizers, irrigation systems, biochemistry, and digitization are bringing
about promising change. To fully harness these innovations, new skills are required to understand,
implement, and monitor and maintain these practices.
With this in mind, Morocco has accordingly taken steps toward understanding and adapting its
agricultural sector to emerging circumstances. For instance, the country has launched a new strategic
25

--- Page 27 ---

plan called “The Generation Green 2020-2030”, which replaces and builds upon the achievements of
its predecessor “The Green Morocco Plan 2008-2020”. The new plan aims to consolidate existing
policies and work in synergy with other national plans, such as the “National Plan for Drinking Water
Supply and Irrigation (2020-2027)” and the INTELAKA program, which offers support and funding to
Micro, Small, and Medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). One particularity of the new plan is that it puts
emphasis on human capital development and inclusivity by seeking to upskill and reskill Moroccan
farmers (with a view to preparing them to adapt to new technologies), promote entrepreneurship in
agriculture through financing programs, and support farmers in their transition towards renewable
energies and resilient and eco-friendly farming methods.41
In terms of technology transfer structures, the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA)
is the leading agricultural research body in the country, with nine scientific departments and ten
regional research centres. An autonomous government institution within the Ministry of Agriculture
that is responsible for crop and livestock research, the INRA runs programs on genetic improvement,
genetic resources conservation, agronomy, machinery, and technology transfer.42
Another important research institute is the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P), which
plays a highly active role in conducting research and driving technological innovation within the
agricultural sector. UM6P is not only home to the “Agricultural Innovation and Technology Transfer
Centre” but also the OCP Group’s Research and Development (R&D) Centre. The latter is working to
develop fertilizers attuned to African crops and soils, as well as to formulate service models that are
specially adapted to African farmers and which will ensure they have reliable and affordable access
to relevant data and products. 43 Moreover, in 2019, UM6P entered into an international academic
partnership with two leading UK agricultural research institutions – Rothamsted Research and
Cranfield University – to work jointly on agricultural research projects and set up a doctoral training
centre that will support the development of the next generation of Moroccan scientists and
engineers.
In January 2021, the university of Ibnou Tofail of Kenitra (UIT) transferred a patent on the
production, formulation and recycling of a biofungicide and biostimulant product to the private
company Agricultural and Trading Company (ATRACO) SARL.44 This accomplishment has been
described as the first of its kind in Morocco, where successful transfer of technology from university
to industry has historically been challenging.
2.3 Biomedicine
The pandemic has put a spotlight on technology transfer and more specifically on home-grown
capabilities. After learning hard lessons from the pandemic, many countries, including Morocco,
began the race towards vaccine self-sufficiency and sovereignty.
In early 2022, Morocco began the construction of a manufacturing vaccine plant, to implement the
SENSYO Pharmatec project – a partnership between the Swedish company Recipharm and a
consortium of Moroccan banks and entities – with the ultimate goal of making the country a regional
hub for pharmaceutical and vaccine innovation. The $500 million project with investment over a five-
year period is set to propel the country into a new era of health science, and will equip the country
with the capacity and capability needed for self-sufficiency.
In line with Morocco’s goal towards local manufacturing and industrialisation of medical products
and solutions, an agreement was penned between the Moroccan ABA Technology Group and the
Moroccan Medical & Biomedical Industrial Cluster (MMI) in December 2021, under the aegis of the
Ministry of Industry and Trade.45 In this partnership, The MMI Cluster will benefit from the ABA
Technology Group’s robust and varied expertise across engineering, manufacturing of electronic
boards, and embedded software and plastic injection dedicated to the medical sector. This expertise
26

--- Page 28 ---

will be leveraged to provide targeted support to the MMI Cluster through the transfer of
technological and industrial know-how in the manufacture of medical devices.
Perhaps another relevant example showcasing instances of technology transfer between two
national entities is that of the partnership between UM6P and the Anoual Laboratory – a leading
medical Moroccan laboratory based out of the city of Casablanca. The two entities had already been
collaborating during the pandemic across several key areas such as the first sequencing of the Sars-
Cov-2 genome, and the implementation of an original diagnostic method for Sars-Cov-2 by infrared
spectroscopy and machine learning.To further advance their partnership by continuing to play out
and mobilise each other’s expertise and strengths in advancing development of new diagnostic
technologies and medical treatment, UM6P and Anoual laboratory signed a partnership agreement in
May 2022.46 The partnership would help develop several research axes in human genomics and
metabolomics and artificial intelligence, paving considerable progress in new diagnostic tools and
technologies, as well as medical treatment of certain cancers and metabolic diseases.
2.4 The automotive sector
In 2017, Morocco ranked the highest of other African countries in UNCTAD’s Liner Shipping
Connectivity Index (LSCI) and the Liner Shipping Bilateral Connectivity Index (LSBCI). These indexes
score various countries based on the quality of links, with an emphasis on routes with transhipments.
47 Morocco’s scores revealed that the country’s best connections include Spain, Belgium, UK, France,
Netherlands, and Germany—all leading automotive industry markets—an advantage that the
country can leverage to build and develop its automotive industry. Official figures reveal that as of
2019, the country’s automotive industry recorded an $8.3 billion in export turnover and a 60%
integration rate, created 220 thousand jobs, counted an estimate of 250 companies operating in the
automotive industry (as compared only to 35 in 2000), and represented 27% of total Moroccan
exports. 48
Morocco laid the ideal ground for an influx of foreign original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and
their suppliers. This was made possible with a strong value proposition, including Morocco’s
advantageous location, reliable infrastructure, land, competitive labour costs, and a number of
financial incentives and support structures:
- Free Trade Zones (FTZs): FTZs have been set up in the cities of Tangiers, Rabat and
Kenitra. Companies operating out of these special economic zones enjoy a range of legal
and financial benefits, such as income tax and VAT exemption, and access to a range of
government services.
- Institutional support: Several entities and task forces have been formed to develop,
implement, and support Morocco’s automotive ecosystem. These include the Directorate
of Automotive industries at the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and the Green and Digital
Economy (MICEVN); the Moroccan Investment and Export Development Agency, which
supports companies with their investment activities in the country; and The Moroccan
Automotive Industry and Trade Association (AMICA), which serves as an interface
between various stakeholders in the industry both public and private.
- Training and capacity building: A network of training and capacity building centre has
been established to address the needs of staff operating in the industry. The Automotive
Industry Training Institutes (IFMIA) run four training centres, one of which is run by
Renault and located in one of Renault’s plants.
27

--- Page 29 ---

As of 2022 the country has four integrated industrial clusters in Casablanca, Rabat, Tangiers, and
Kenitra, as well as four specialised training institutes, one of which is run by Renault. Tangiers
remains the locale where most of the industry’s activity is clustered. The major industrial players
operating in Morocco include China’s BYD, Renault- Nissan, and PSA Peugeot-Citroen, and key
automotive part suppliers include: Japan-based Yazaki, Germany-based Schlemmer, Ireland-based
Delphi Technologies, and US-based Lear Corporation.
To manage the growth of the automotive sector in the coming years, Morocco restructured the
industry by adopting a new ecosystem approach with the chief objective of ensuring better visibility
across the value chain, better organisation, focused support, and above all, promoting greater
integration of the sector. The country counts eight specific ecosystems49:
- Automotive wiring. Main operators include Delphi, Yazaki, Leoni, Lear, Stahlschmidt and
Fujikura.
- Metal pressing. Main operators include Socafix and Gestamp.
- Automotive batteries. Main operators include Electra and Maribat.
- Vehicle interior and seats. Principal operators include SIGIT and Faurecia.
- Heavy goods vehicles and industrial bodywork; Scania Morocco and Irizar are among the
main operators.
- Motors transmission (Powertrain); the main operator is Global Mecaplast.
- Renault manufacturing
- Peugeot SA manufacturing
In line with its accelerated strategy to become the world’s most competitive automotive hub,
Morocco recognises the importance of expanding R&D activities. In support of this aim, the country
multiplied efforts to host a number of leading R&D centres in order to catalyse the technical and
technological progress of Morocco’s automotive sector, and consequently, its technology transfer
across the entire automotive value chain. These R&D centres include:
- The Technical Centre for Vehicle Equipment Industries (CETIEV 2.0): A centre dedicated to
Stellantis (a merger of Fiat Chrysler automobile and Peugeot SA) R&D activities which
brings a new expertise to Moroccan R&D. It is comprised of a physical testing facility
linked to the activities of automobile development and validation which was previously
conducted abroad. It specifically concerns electric, mechatronics, acoustic testing. 50
- FEV and UTAC CERAM centre: A cutting edge development and testing centre born of a
joint venture between the German FEV, a leading service provider of vehicle and
powertrain development for hardware and software, and the French UTAC CERAM, an
independent service provider in all areas of land transport.51 This centre will help
Morocco become autonomous where the homologation of parts and vehicles is
concerned.
While the increasing presence of multinational companies in Morocco is setting the country on the
path to becoming a global leader in the automotive industry and furthering its industrialisation, it
should be noted that the number of Moroccan owned companies in the industry remains
concerningly small. Such circumstances call for a refocused strategy, one in which increased
government intervention is required to expand the role of Moroccan firms in the national economy.
This can be achieved by integrating Moroccan firms into the industry’s national value chain by
ensuring access to capital and, most importantly, continuous access to learning and transfer of
knowledge from the global players operating in the country.

2.5 The defence sector
Over the years, Morocco leveraged its bilateral connections to strengthen its defence sector.
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Morocco is the third
largest arms buyer in Africa for the period extending from 2012 to 2021, just behind Egypt and
Algeria – and 25th globally, accounting for 1% of global arms imports for the same period.52 The
United States is the country’s top arms supplier, with imports including advanced arms and
ammunition.
Beyond imports, Morocco’s bilateral and multilateral defence partnership encompasses multiple
military exercises, training, counter-terrorism operations, and stabilization participation, by which
Morocco can strengthen its military capabilities through human and technical interoperability. The
increasingly critical role that Morocco plays in sustaining peace and security in what is considered a
highly volatile geostrategic environment granted the country the praise of the international defence
community. Today, Morocco is considered a Major non-NATO-ally (MNNA) and is one of the 15
partner countries of NATO’s Defence Education Enhancement Programme (DEEP), a programme for
defence capacity and institution building.53
Amid the ever-evolving international context, Morocco places industrial sovereignty across a number
of sectors as a matter of priority. For years, it has expressed its ambition to develop the defence
industry, allowing for relief from its heavy dependence on foreign military equipment and arms. To
put their proposal into practice, the country enacted Law n° 10-20 in July 2021, relating to security
and defence equipment and material, and arms and ammunition.54 The law serves as a framework to
establish an industrial and technological basis for the country’s defence industry. The new framework
specifically paves the progressive path of establishing private industrial units in the country, thereby
offering numerous incentives that would enable foreign investors to choose the country. Such
incentives include VAT exemption on sales for public organs in charge of security and defence and a
possible derogation from the Moroccan law dictating that setting up a business in the country would
require a mostly Moroccan capital. Although the road to achieving this in the defence industry is one
that is both long and fraught with challenges, the country nonetheless aims to, slowly and surely,
develop its own military industry. Law n° 10-20 represents a pivotal milestone in developing and
regulating the industry while incentivising foreign players to establish ties in the country, thereby
drawing strategic and economic benefits from it.
Another strategy adopted by Morocco to fortify the defence industry is to leverage existing
relationships with key trade partners. For instance, in 2019, Morocco and Brazil signed a deal to
share military technology; the agreement focuses on several core areas of research and
development, science and technology, logistical support and acquisition of defence products and
services.55 In another example of defence diplomacy, following the normalization agreement
between Morocco and the State of Israel in 2020 – and brokered with the US assistance – Morocco
and Israel signed in November 2021 a defence memorandum including the exchange of experiences,
expertise and technology transfer.56 Other countries understood to have technology transfer
agreements with Morocco in defence and counterterrorism include India, Pakistan, and Turkey.
To duplicate the success of its automotive and aerospace industry exports, Morocco began
expressing keenness – as early as 2017 – to become military arms and equipment producing country.
Such plans finally began to materialise in April 2022. In what has been labelled a “significant
cooperation”, Belgian aerospace firms Sabca and Sabena entered into a strategic partnership with
Lockheed Martin, an American aerospace, arms, defence, information security, and technology
corporation, to build a new military aircraft maintenance facility in Morocco. The partnership
includes the construction of a state-of-the-art 15,000 sqm Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul and
Upgrade (MRO&U) centre for military aircraft and helicopters at Benslimane Airport.57 In addition to
the new jobs it is expected the create, the added value to the country lies in the fact that such a plant
will allow the country to receive the best industrial facility, equipment, training and certification to
29

support the Royal Moroccan Air Force. Most importantly, however, it serves as a medium for
technology transfer and lays the perfect ground for the country to develop its own plants in the
future.
2.6 Academia
In December 2021, Morocco celebrated its first anniversary of renewed diplomatic ties with the state
of Israel, which forged several bonds across many sectors. The most notable is in that of academia,
where a partnership between the University of Jerusalem and UM6P aims to promote academic
collaborations between the two universities — from student and academic staff exchanges to joint
research and collaborative degrees.58 In September 2021, UIR and Israel’s Ben-Gurion University of
the Negev signed a MoU to collaborate on research and education;59 specifically the two institutions
seek to develop a scientific partnership through joint research, teaching, student, and staff mobility.
Similarly, in April 2021, Morocco began the process of its association with the European Programme
“Horizon Europe”60 — the EU’s key funding program for research and innovation with a budget of
95.5 billion Euros.61 By becoming an “Associated country,” Moroccan researchers will access the
program’s call for projects. The program will also encourage and facilitate their rapprochement with
the EU Member States, companies, NGOs, and social partners in exploiting research and technology
transfer.
In another example of science diplomacy, Morocco signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU)
with Hungary62 in November 2019, to step up academic cooperation and scientific research; the
initiative intends to develop joint programs in scientific research and technology transfer in addition
to students and teachers exchange programs between the two countries. Similarly, Morocco and
Vietnam in December 2021 — celebrating their 60thanniversary of relations — signed a declaration of
intent to deepen cooperation opportunities in scientific research and innovation through a raft of
measures; including an academic forum every two years, joint research programs, and the exchange
of university experiences and mobility of student and researchers.

3. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER KEY
CHALLENGES
Despite the numerous initiatives undertaken by Morocco to promote technology transfer, current
efforts remain riddled with challenges. Today, strategic plans are underway to correct the path and
solve a number of issues. Some challenges are more complex than others and therefore require
both an integrated approach and inter-ministerial cooperation. From the perspective of a research
institution, commercialising and promoting research outputs is difficult not only due to lack of
resources, but also researchers' lack of understanding regarding the commercial value of their work.
Bridging the proverbial “Valley of death” has been difficult due to the industry’s lack of absorption
capacity, compounded by the difference in cultures between academia and their respective
industries.
At the firm level, start-ups are the backbone of numerous African countries, but do not play a
dynamic role in the Moroccan R&D, particularly in technology transfer. This is partly due to stiff
legal and fiscal policies and partly due to technology transfer simply not being a priority. For
established SMEs, however, Morocco’s offshoring industry represents a key opportunity to explore
technology transfer opportunities if the necessary pre-requisites are met, such as continuous access
to financing and capacity building programmes to increase chances of integration in the industry.
Overall, the absence of necessary national indicators and a system for tracking, monitoring and
evaluation to thoroughly understand technology transfer activities in research institutions and
firms, calls into question the validity and efficiency of existing mechanisms and data used to design
policies.

3.1 The challenge of brain drain
In an increasingly global world and ever-evolving tectonic market shifts, we see developed countries
becoming both importers and exporters of talent. This is translated in the number of foreign expats
we see in developed countries, especially in middle eastern countries such as the UAE. According to a
Linkedin study63, more talent is now heading to the Middle-East, Africa, and South Africa, showing an
impressive reverse of flow.
As of 2021, Morocco has the highest rate of brain drain in the Middle-East and North African region
after Syria64. The phenomenon is specifically seen among graduates who often, after completing their
studies abroad, decide to stay abroad, where several high-skilled and global talent visas offer the
path for residency and citizenship. The bulk of Moroccan engineers are in Europe, specifically in
France, a choice that is particularly attractive due to the shared languages and historical links that
makes cultural integration easier. However, it should be noted that the Moroccan diaspora can more
recently be found in the US, Germany, Canada, and the UK; a slight tilt towards English speaking
countries from where they hope to head to the middle east and work for Emirati, Saudi, or Qatari
companies.
The issue of brain drain is acknowledged and openly debated in Morocco, where retention of local
talent is making its place in key strategic plans. Several initiatives were undertaken to address the
push and pull factors that lie behind the brain drain in Morocco such as unemployment, inadequate
policies, poor entrepreneurial system, lack of incentives, inability of the local economy to absorb and
appreciate talent, and much more. Initiatives have also been taken to encourage the return of skilled
Moroccans and retain the local talent:
- To curb the outflow of students to France, some prestigious French schools established
outposts in Morocco such as l’ESSEC, Centrale, INSA and more, offering the same programs
that are taught in France. While this initiative could benefit Moroccan students by offering
them a world-class education and a foreign degree in the comfort of their home country,
others are yet to be convinced that this option is as enriching as an experience abroad where
they are immersed in a multi-cultural environment and are pushed out of their comfort zone.
- Extend a welcoming hand to Moroccans abroad through the FINCOME program: FINCOME,
translated from Moroccan Arabic for “where are you”, is a programme that aims to mobilize
the skills of Moroccans living abroad; this is achieved through a database of qualified
Moroccans abroad that are called upon to support research, training and development
activities in the country and ensure a continuous flow of knowledge exchange and transfer,
either on a perennial or limited basis. This will bridge the gap between Moroccans at home
and abroad and strengthen this bond through various bilateral cooperation projects.
Morocco has a devoted a great deal of effort to addressing brain drain, and while some progress has
been made, it remains to be seen whether the initiatives will lead to successful and
sustainable results. The general sentiment amongst youth is that a move abroad has more to offer
than staying home. Whilst opportunities abroad are easily found in some cases due to the local
economy’s inability to absorb a large amount of talent, there’s also a long-held belief that those who
emigrated are living a more fulfilling and rewarding life, assuming that such satisfaction is exclusive
to travelling and living abroad due to perceptions of a lack of local opportunities. The attraction and
encouragement of living, studying, and working abroad is a routine topic of discussion within the
rising talents in Morocco. However, Morocco’s evolution over recent years appears to be largely
ignored in the decision-making process of these prospective talents.
32

--- Page 34 ---

3.2 Lack of funding and incentives
Overall, policy dialogue on technology transfer in Morocco appears to be primarily focused on
universities. This could mistakenly convey the idea that universities are supposed to assume a larger
role in technology transfer systems, while in fact, the process is highly interactive and requires wide
collaboration between different partners, including firms. Notwithstanding this dominating narrative,
public research institutions (including universities) and firms face the same challenge which is lack of
funds and incentives to engage and invest in R&D activities in a substantive way.
At the university-level, the role and status of the researcher are not well-defined, specifically where
research output, ownership and commercialisation are concerned. This not only limits the
researcher’s scope but also sets them back in the absence of any incentive that would reward them
for innovation; it isn’t clear whether universities have in place a reward system or research or
innovation-related KPI for career advancement. Additionally, it is not clear whether there’s a unified
research strategy that governs Moroccan universities; the same applies to research budget within
universities, it is unclear how the research budget is allocated.
At the industry level, R&D activities inside Moroccan companies remain very limited in the absence
of incentives such as tax breaks. Indeed, the majority of firms in Morocco rely on technology sourced
from abroad as it is perceived as a strategic choice to cut costs that would have otherwise been
incurred by long and heavy investment in R&D activities. With that being said, and looking at the
local market overall, the outputs of research & development labs are often too sophisticated for the
local industry to absorb them, resulting in what could be perceived as a waste of time and resources
or, in the most optimistic scenarios, a long journey to commercialization.
3.3 Cultural difference between university and industry
In addition to the challenges aforementioned, cultural differences between universities and industry
present another gap that must be bridged. Indeed, the two operate in two different environments
with different sets of rules, missions, and mandates (see table below).
Parameter Academia Industry
Research type Basic research Applied research
Research Orientation Curiosity-driven research Problem-solved driven
Time horizon Long-term Short-term
Output New knowledge New product
Openness Publication & Openness Ownership and Confidentiality
Research strategy Scientific freedom Technology roadmaps
Cultural mindset Sharing Control
Responsibility Social responsibilities Shareholders’ responsibilities
Cultural differences between academia and industry.
Source: European Commission, The Open Innovation 2.0 Yearbook, 2015.
The contrasting modes of thinking and operation call for flexibility from both sides. Universities, and
more specifically TTOs, must be well equipped with the marketing, commercialisation and execution
skills to “speak the language” of the industry.
33

--- Page 35 ---

Industry, on the other hand, must show more willingness to scout, absorb, adopt, and exploit
external innovation to complement and improve internal capabilities and consequently,
competitivity. The divergence of culture between academia and industry is quite pronounced in
Morocco for two reasons. Firstly, the lack of interaction between the two around collaboration is a
problem; students find difficulties finding internships in the country because the local economy is not
developed enough to absorb emerging talent, especially in STEM. Secondly, the concept of “learning
by doing” or industrial placement is non-existent in the country, but MESRI is exploring it as part of
its PACTE ESRI 2030.
Bridging this gap in culture is particularly important as universities file the highest number of patents
in the country, but rarely succeed in commercialising them, a task that is often assigned to
Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs). The most notable examples of TTOs in the country were
highlighted in the previous section, but such structures remain scarce and lack the substantial skills,
expertise, and means required to play an active role in assisting universities in commercialisation. To
address this, foundations were laid in the first quarter of 2022 to set up TTOs in a number of
Moroccan universities with the support of OMPIC, which will assist in defining the business and
governance model of developed structures.

4.RECOMMENDATIONS
Over the past two decades, Morocco has made significant and impressive progress building its
science, technology, and innovation ecosystem. It has also recently announced plans to usher in a
new era of home-grown capabilities – for Moroccans, by Moroccans. A transformational programme
was announced in early 2022 by the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Research, and
Innovation. This initiative would overhaul the Moroccan educational system and transform Moroccan
universities through the adoption of University 4.0, ready to respond to the new global economy and
associated technological trends.
It is still too early to assess the potential of such strategies in tangibly improving Morocco’s
technology transfer ecosystem; however, an analysis of the current system has unveiled several
challenges which require a multi-stakeholder and multidimensional approach. This is in order to
improve the existing technology transfer infrastructure and address the internal and external
variables that influence the technology transfer value chain in the country. Progress lies first and
foremost in the hands of the government, and the key actions at the forefront of any technology
transfer strategy are as follows:
Yearly or biennial surveys on national technology transfer systems. A multistakeholder committee
should be formed to monitor technology transfer activities. Despite previous plans by MESRI to form
such a committee, it has yet to be created. Such a committee would be under the responsibility of
several ministries, including MESRI, MIC, and the Ministry of Digital Transition and Administrative
Reform. The committee should be mandated to commission yearly or biennial surveys on the
technology transfer system in the country, covering both firms and research institutions, creating a
national registry for technology transfer activities in the country, and providing policy guidance based
on practices observed both at home and abroad.
Create a multitude of educated professionals and entrepreneurs. This goal is two-fold: firstly, it
aims to reduce dependability on external resources and capabilities, and grow and strengthen
domestic industry; secondly, it aims to grow the capacity to create innovation and support an
effective transfer of technologies from the innovation source, to the industry.
Address the human capital flight. Many skilled Moroccans are moving abroad, and this trend has not
shown any signs of slowing. Whilst mobility is a human right, devoting significant resources to
education becomes counter-productive when the developed talent leaves the country. This problem
should be addressed from three angles: improving information access about, to, and from the
Moroccan diaspora; understanding their needs; and adopting a multi-stakeholder dialogue approach
to design effective strategies to entice and mobilise the Moroccan diaspora to take an active role in
the development of the country.
Several options should be explored. This includes enlisting their expertise for short-term missions in
the country to rebuild ties with their home-country; multiplying the number of worldwide networks
to ensure continuous engagement and funding, which could be led by Moroccan missions abroad;
exploring hybrid engagement strategies – physical, virtual, full-time, and part-time – to transfer skills;
35

--- Page 37 ---

and improving access to information on job opportunities in Morocco, starting with Moroccan
students who study abroad.
Introduce and enact a start-up bill. Many African countries have enacted start-up bills, including
Senegal, Nigeria, Kenya and Tunisia, Rwanda, and Ethiopia. Morocco should begin the dialogue on a
framework that defines the relationship between the government and start-ups. A start-up act would
encourage the development and growth of start-ups through fiscal and non-fiscal support, while
creating a business environment in which government, entrepreneurs, investors, and civil society
work together toward a common goal. Subtle debate has emerged in recent years to define the legal
status of start-ups in Morocco. Such a bill would not only address this issue but would also
consolidate existing laws on start-ups.
Promote the use of the English language in teaching and learning. English is the international
language of business and research. In Morocco, Arabic and French remain the official languages
across the sectors of academia and business, although a limited number of universities offer English
curriculums. Introducing multilingual curriculums could promote research collaboration and improve
employment prospects.
Promote industrial placements. Experiential learning, or “learning by doing”, is virtually non-existent
in the Moroccan academic experience. An industrial placement could offer an extended period of
work experience during which university students can take a hands-on approach in applying their
learnings in the workplace, and therefore acquire new skills. Such experiences prepare students for
the corporate world and allow students understand the commercial value of innovation.
Increase the budget dedicated to research. Although this has been a priority for several years,
current funding is still not sufficient for generating the expected added value for the country.
Encourage research contribution and productivity at the university. This starts with allocating
sufficient funds for research at the university level and providing appropriate compensation and
incentives to research participants. In Morocco, the results of publicly funded research and
development belong to the institution at which the research was undertaken, as is the case in most
countries. However, there are instances where the institution may not have the resources to exploit
the result of an invention. In such cases, it could be beneficial to transfer the IP ownership to
researcher.
Encourage the participation of the private sector in R&D activities. Despite the private sector’s role
in the conception of many national strategies, such as the Moroccan Innovation Strategy, private
sector involvement in R&D in Morocco is rare to non-existent. This is often attributed to a lack of
incentives. Tax credits and subsidies have generally proven effective in inducing a certain degree of
participation of the private sector in R&D, and should be considered here.
Better define the structure and legal status of incubators in Morocco. This specifically applies to
university incubators that occupy various positions inside the university, ranging from support
services and small structures – to large structures with multiple partners. Modern times call for a
unified model across all universities in Morocco, where all incubators operate under the same
procedures and standards. Additionally, incubators do not enjoy autonomy vis-a-vis the university;
they are highly dependent on the funding and human resources allocated by the university. These
36

--- Page 38 ---

resources are often not enough to sustain the operations of the incubator and take promising ideas
off the ground.
Consolidate current initiatives and structures to promote innovation. There are several initiatives
and support structures to promote innovation and scientific research; however, they often do not
appear to work in synergy. Additionally, programs are often discontinued, which is in part due to the
new cabinets after each election cycle. New cabinet members often dismantle their predecessors’
programs without fully assessing their merit and efficiency, before announcing new ones.
Instore monitoring and evaluation (M&E) mechanisms for STI activities in Morocco. To simply
document, analyse and report on research and technology transfer activities in terms of performance
and impact.
