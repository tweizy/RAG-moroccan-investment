6 SNAPSHOT
Morocco in brief
At home, Morocco has identified the reduction of social inequality as a key priority, setting in motion a series of reforms and transferring
critical development funds to less-developed regions. Abroad, Morocco’s foreign policy objectives focus on spearheading intra-African
cooperation and positioning itself at the centre of Europe-Africa relations. Gains were made on all these fronts in 2019, supported
by growing GDP that reached $118.5bn in 2018. However, vulnerabilities remain in the form of a large agriculture sector dependent
on weather and commodity prices, as well as a substantial energy import bill whose size is dictated by international oil and gas prices.

of that season's drought.
Although it remains a vital part of the economy,
the sector's contribution to GDP has been gradually
falling, accounting for around 13% as of mid-2019. At
the same time, other sectors have been increasing
in importance. The industrial sector, for example,
has gradually transitioned to higher value-added
production. Its share of GDP has risen from an aver-
age of 19% between 1985 and 2016 to 25% in 2017.
The sector's contribution remained unchanged as of
early 2019, according to the African Development
Bank. In recent years, the kingdom has focused on
developing export-oriented products and services,
with an emphasis on segments such as aeronautics
and motor vehicle manufacturing. The mining sector,
meanwhile, contributes around 10% of GDP and 20%
of the country's total exports.

16 COUNTRY PROFILE OVERVIEW
King Mohammed VI’s reign has been characterised
by a focus on social and economic development. He
has played a key role in initiating several liberalising
reforms, among the most significant of which was
the creation of the country's new constitution in
2011, amid a climate of political and social unrest.
Despite these reforms, some civil society organisa-
tions are advocating for additional changes, largely
related to human rights and freedom of the press.
In July 2019 King Mohammed VI celebrated the
20th anniversary of his accession to the throne
following the death of his father King Hassan II, who
had ruled since 1961. He is the third monarch to rule
Morocco since it gained independence from France
in 1956. The Moroccan royal family is known as the
Alawite dynasty, and the king is considered to be a
descendant of the Prophet Muhammad.
Royal speeches have frequently prompted the
government to take specific actions as well as guided
broad policy objectives. For example, the 15-year
strategy to reform the education system, which was

on July 23, 2019 he called for the creation of a com-

for the authorities. Between 2012 and 2017 the
country’s budget deficit was significantly reduced,
from some 7.3% of GDP to 3%. The budget deficit was
expected to hover around 3.7% of GDP for 2019, with
the authorities planning to bring it down to 3% over
the coming years. Increasing tax revenue has been a
central part of this progress, with tax collection rising
from approximately Dh208.9bn ($21.8bn) in 2015 to
Dh242.5bn ($25.3bn) in 2018.
Debt, however, increased significantly over the past
decade, most of it triggered by the 2008 global finan-
cial crisis, leading debt to expand from 47% of GDP to
64.9% of GDP between 2009 and 2018. However, the
country is expected to bring it down to 60% of GDP
by 2024, according to the IMF report.

REGULATIONS: One of the most important regu-
latory changes was the January 2018 adoption of
International Financial Reporting Standard 9 (IFRS 9).
The standard upgrades banks’ loan classification and
provisioning practices, which is particularly relevant
given the high level of NPLs. In particular, the first-time

may need to raise capital by issuing shares or – more
likely – conserve capital, either by constricting lending
or distributing less as dividends.

that strengthened the role and independence of BAM.

National Financial Inclusion Strategy in April 2019.
The key pillars of the strategy are to accelerate the
development of alternative finance models such as
mobile payment, microfinance and inclusive insurance;
encourage traditional banks to prioritise financial
inclusion; develop tools to better understand the
barriers to accessing finance for underserved people
and businesses; promote the use of financial products;
and put in place an appropriate governance structure.
In February 2019 the authorities and the World Bank
agreed a $700m financing programme to support
the strategy’s implementation and the transition to
a digital economy. Seven inter-institutional, thematic
working groups were launched in September 2019 to
deliver various elements of the strategy. “The over-

Nevertheless, it outperformed other market indices,
including the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which
declined by 16.6% that year. “With price/earnings
ratios around 18:1, some might say that valuations
are stretched compared to regional peers,” Mehdi
Chakir, equity research analyst at CFG Bank, told
OBG. “However, one must understand that the cost
of capital is much lower in Morocco than in Tunisia,
for example, which justifies higher valuations. In
some respects, Moroccan equities trade more like
European than MENA equivalents.” Elaborating on
the market dynamic, Chakir added that “local insti-
tutional investors are a captive audience. While they
are permitted to invest up to 10% of their portfolios
in foreign equities, this is closer to 1% in practice,
largely due to capital controls”.

On the policy side, in April 2017 Moroccan author-

gramme to be implemented through to 2022. The
plan aims to create approximately 370 new manu-
facturing units and over 38,000 additional jobs. At
least a third of the new factories are expected to
benefit from financial support from the government.
Although many agro-industrial producers in the
kingdom are focused on exports, there is signifi-
cant potential for growth in the domestic market,
as imports continue to be substantial. Imports of
retail-related food products from abroad reached
$1.4bn in May 2019, according to figures by the US

Incentives play important role in attracting man-

majority of production is for export. Additionally,
the authorities offer subsidies for industrial land
acquisition, as much as 30% of rebates on invest-

The automotive and automotive parts segment
has been a key job creator, employing some 180,000
people in the kingdom as of late 2019. The two larg-

Morocco’s geographic location and climate con-

able energy segment. According to government
estimates, the country has around 3000 hours of
sunlight per day and an annual solar energy poten-
tial of 5 KWh per sq metre. Morocco also has sig-
nificant wind generation potential, measured at
approximately 5000 TWh per year, and a potential

Although hydropower generation has been in
place in Morocco since the 1960s, new dams are
expected to open in the coming years. According
to the most recent IEA figures, the country had
roughly 1770 MW of installed hydropower capacity
in 2017. While there is little scope for new large-
scale hydroelectric power stations, several small
and medium-sized projects are in progress.
The largest project currently underway is the

TRANSPORT OF GOODS: The transport market is
largely characterised by singular private operators
and an ageing fleet. The largest actor, the state-owned
National Transport and Logistics Company, owns over
130,000 vehicles, has over 210,000 sq metres in stor-
age capacity and transports about 20,000 tonnes of
goods annually. However, excluding informal actors,
approximately 80% of the 84,300 companies operating
in the transport sector own less than two vehicles, with
one-third of these vehicles over 15 years old.
Some 75% of the value of all transported goods is
moved via the country’s road network, so improvements
in road quality and fleet efficiency translate to immedi-
ate benefits for the entire sector and wider economy.
To this end, the METL implemented new measures in
March 2019 aimed at increasing freight capacity by at
least 30% for vehicles transporting three to 19 tonnes.

GDP, exceeding the 15% goal set by the agency in 2015.
By comparison, logistics costs represent 10-16% of GDP
in Europe and 15-17% in emerging markets. With 60% of
costs of road transportation related to trans-shipment,
the AMDL is building an interconnected grid aimed at
increasing efficiency. Despite slow progress towards the
agency’s goals, storage costs dropped by 35% between
2010 and 2019 to reach Dh35 ($3.65) per month for
rent and Dh1.90 ($0.20) per day per pallet, according
to the OMCL. In 2016 the transport and logistics sector
received about Dh32.3bn ($3.4bn) in investment, or
10% of total investment, and generated 24,000 jobs.
The availability of land and its affordability in and
around the kingdom’s economic centres continue
to pose challenges for logistics businesses. By 2030,
however, the AMDL plans to develop 3300 ha of mul-
ti-flow logistics parks, 1100 ha of which are planned
for the greater Casablanca area. These parks will offer

The water segment was also a major recipient of
construction funding, receiving a total of Dh6.4bn
($666.8m), divided among urban and rural drinking
water supply and water sanitation. As cities rapidly
expand and Morocco’s economy remains dominated
by the agriculture sector, water systems are a major
part of the country’s public infrastructure strategy.
Furthermore, the Priority Programme for Drinking
Water Supply and Irrigation 2020-27 was adopted in
January 2020, which plans to allocate a total of Dh115bn
($12bn) to the development of water infrastructure
over the seven-year period. This investment will go
towards the construction of 20 dams, with the goal of
raising water storage capacity from 5.4bn cu metres
to 27.3bn cu metres by 2027.
PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS: In order to meet
its infrastructure financing needs, which are estimated
at 8-14% of GDP, Morocco is increasingly looking to

REAL ESTATE OVERVIEW 149
As of late 2019 some 80% of all residential build-
ings under construction fell within the parameters
of social housing. Such projects benefit from tax
waivers and duties payable exemptions, in addition
to a value-added tax break for buyers and easier
access to credit. However, these incentives are set
to end in December 2020, and many stakeholders
are waiting to see if the benefits will be extended or
revised in some way. Mansour also notes that many
families who can afford homes in the Dh350,000-
800,000 ($36,500-83,300) price range cannot find
properties that cater to the segment, and thus fall
back on social housing, which keeps demand high.
One problem with social housing is that the loca-
tions where many of the units are being built are in
new areas that lack proper city infrastructure, due
to cheaper and more available land. “There is robust
demand for properties in the Dh150,000-300,000
($15,600-31,300) price range and about 1m unoc-

growth during the same time.
The dependence of the sector’s value added on
weather patterns has started to be somewhat mit-
igated, due to the reduction of the relative weight
of cereal production in the overall structure of the
sector. In a mid-2019 report, the Ministry of Economy
and Finance estimated that while an 81% decrease
in cereal production caused by drought lowered
the sector’s value added by 41% in 1995, a similar
drought-driven decrease of 71% in 2016 only shrank
agricultural value added by 13.7%.
INVESTMENT: A key goal of the PMV was to boost
private and public investment volumes. To do this,
the authorities introduced new support measures,
such as backing agricultural goods to facilitate higher
productivity and added value in order to capture

to figures by the MAPMDREF, irrigation accounts
for 99% of sugar production, 82% of vegetable out-

milk production. The PMV has worked to not only
increase irrigated areas, but, when possible, substi-
tute traditional irrigation systems for drip irrigation

in Irrigation, which has operated with a budget of

entertainment, sports and leisure was to pair such
offerings with existing infrastructure.
Under Vision 2020, policymakers also highlighted
the need to strengthen the sector’s tourist opera-

were launched. Moussanada Siyaha was allocated a

GUIDING POLICY: Vision 2020, the sector’s current
development strategy that was created in 2010, has
acted as a roadmap to focus efforts on expanding
tourism’s footprint. The policy was built around the
promotion of six products that are adapted to the
kingdom’s competitive advantages: beach and resort
offerings; ecotourism; entertainment; sports and
leisure; local tourism; and heritage tourism.
Through the development of these segments,
Moroccan authorities endeavoured to make the
country one of the world’s top-20 tourism destina-
tions by 2020. Other objectives included reaching
20m visitors per year; doubling the number of beds
at accommodation units to 400,000; and creating

HIGH EXPECTATIONS: While helping to grow
the tourism sector and boost visitor volume, the
implementation of Vision 2020 has fallen short,
and many of the goals were unmet as of early 2020.
This trajectory was made clear by the kingdom’s
Court of Audit in a 2018 report that looked at the
strategy’s achievements by 2015, at the midpoint of
the plan. The court found that Vision 2020 had been
based on excessive optimism regarding the sector’s
expansion and that it had not fully capitalised on the
achievements made under the government’s previ-
ous strategy for the sector, which spanned 2000-10.
Moreover, the court concluded that the strategy’s
project application was advancing too slowly, with
a mere 37 projects finalised as of late 2015 out of
a total 944 projects that were initially planned. The
total investment anticipated for those projects was
Dh151bn ($15.7bn), yet up until end-2015 only about
Dh1.4bn ($145.9m) had been spent, according to

to over 2m nights, pointing to the city’s increasing
attractiveness as the economic capital.
However, data shows that while Morocco contin-
ues to attract high numbers of visitors to its main
destinations, efforts to expose a larger volume of
foreign visitors to the country’s other points of
interest have lagged behind. For instance, Fez, which
is one of Morocco’s most iconic ancient cities, cap-
tured 5% of all hotel nights spent by foreigners in the
kingdom in 2018, although total nights in the city
increased by 16% that year. High growth potential
is also visible in Essaouira, which accounted for 2%
of hotel nights, but saw its number increase by 11%.
NEW HOTELS: In line with demand, the building
of new hotels has continued across some of the
kingdom’s more attractive vacation spots in 2019.

responsible for roughly 74.5% of all deaths. While
the rise in deaths associated with NCDs can be par-
tially attributed to positive changes like longer life
expectancies and lower instances of communicable
diseases, lifestyle-related choices such as tobacco use
and poor diet also contribute to the growing numbers.
In February 2019 the MoH unveiled a Dh5.4bn
($563m) national strategy to address and prevent
NCDs. The strategy, prepared in partnership with the
WHO, sets a number of targets to be completed by
2029. One of the main objectives of the strategy is
to promote healthier lifestyles by establishing goals
such as a 20% reduction of tobacco consumption and
a 10% decline in overall salt consumption. To achieve
these goals, the strategy indicates a need for greater
ongoing efforts to educate the public about NCDs
and healthy lifestyle habits. It also calls for the con-
solidation of health care services aimed at disease
prevention. The strategy aims to reduce premature
deaths caused by NCDs by 25% by 2029.

HEALTH OVERVIEW 205
Another key aspect of the MoH’s drug policy is
ensuring that drug costs in Morocco match inter-
national benchmarks. According to the new decree,
the MoH may lower prices if local drug prices exceed
international benchmarks, and pharmaceutical com-
panies may request to commercialise drugs at higher
prices if local prices are below these benchmarks.
Although the majority of revisions since 2014 have
involved price cuts, in April 2019 the MoH increased
the prices of 14 drugs. The increases in the public
selling prices for the drugs ranged from Dh2 ($0.20)
to Dh150 ($15.63), and included brand-name medi-
cations such as those used to treat cancer, epilepsy
and cardiovascular issues. Sintrom, a medication used
to prevent blood clots, saw the lowest increase, from
Dh17.90 ($1.87) and Dh20 ($2.08). Protamine Choay,
meanwhile, a medication that is most commonly
used during heart surgery, was subject to the high-

private education has almost doubled, increasing
from 576,700 in 2009 to about 1.04m at the start of
2018/19. In contrast, the number of students in public
school grew by 9% over the same period, rising from
5.7m to reach approximately 6.1m.
More resources and the prospect of better aca-

August 25, 2016, providing a new legal framework
for the way the CSE is operated today.
In order to revitalise the stock market, the legal
framework brought by Law No. 19-14 splits the stock
exchange into two markets: the first being for com-
panies with large market capitalisation, while the
second, with less demanding access rules, is for
smaller companies, which grants them access to
important financing resources.
The first and main market consists of four subdi-
visions, two for the trading of equity securities, one
for mutual funds and one for debt securities. The
second market comprises at least two subdivisions
for equity and bond transactions.
The new legal framework also enhanced pruden-
tial rules in addition to reinforcing the supervisory
and control powers of the Moroccan Authority of
Capital Markets (Autorité Marocaine du Marché des
Capitaux, AMMC) on stock exchange companies and
professionals, notably by organising and supervising
all services and investment advice activities, which

corpus was promulgated with Law No. 60-16 of July
2016, replacing the previous investment charter
that was adopted in 1995. The investment reform
provided for a restructuring of investment promo-
tion activities vested in the newly created Moroccan
Investment and Export Development Agency.
Several of the incentives established in the orig-
inal charter were extended to cover all companies
that meet the required conditions to benefit from
tax advantages, whether located in free zones or
not. This allowed such firms to avail themselves
of tax benefits, particularly those available to
exporting industries, and of a five-year corporate
tax exemption for new industrial companies. How-
ever, the Finance Law of 2020 repealed the five-year
exemption for exporting companies that will carry
out their first export operation starting January
1, 2020. Indeed, as of January 1, 2020 exporting
companies will be subject to taxation at the reduced
progressive rate of 20% applied to the portion whose
net profit is higher than Dh1m ($104,000).

228 LEGAL FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW
This authorisation is granted as a visa stamped on
the employment contract.
The date of the visa is the date at which the
employment contract takes effect. However, any
modification to said contract requires a new visa
and the authorisation may be withdrawn at any
time by the MEIP. A new visa may also be required
every year in case of indefinite-term employment.
In terms of the foregoing, Moroccan courts used
to consider the employment contracts entered into
by foreign employees as fixed-term employment
contracts given that they enter into force on the
date of the visa’s issuance and end on the expiration
date set by the MEIP. It is worth noting that this
interpretation was contrary to the non-discrimi-
nation principle set forth in the Moroccan Labour
Code, as well as the international treaties signed by
Morocco, and was continuously protested against
by many associations and NGOs which brought the
matter to Parliament.

EMPLOYMENT LAW: Law No. 65-99, promulgated
by Dahir No. 1-03-194 of September 11, 2003, forms
the Moroccan Labour Code.
In 2003 the Labour Code aligned the legal frame-
work for local employment with most modern
employment legislations and practices. It did this
by raising the minimum age for employment to 15
years of age, promoting gender equality, focusing
on employee health and safety at the workplace,
as well as protecting workers who belong to trade
unions, among other measures.
On another note, the status of foreign employ-
ees has seen a major change recently. In fact, any
employer wishing to hire a foreign employee must
first obtain an authorisation from the Ministry of
Employment and Professional Integration (Ministère
de l’Emploi et de l’Insertion Professionnelle, MEIP). Law No. 13-09 of 2010 regulates the development of renewable energy

system, had a monopoly on the production of elec-

the supply of electricity must still be undertaken

The law also established the principle that any
