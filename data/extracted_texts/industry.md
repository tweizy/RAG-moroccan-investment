About the Industrial Energy Accelerator
In partnership with key government agencies and industry stakeholders, the Industrial Energy Accelerator
works on the ground to rally government, industry and finance around solutions that ignite change in
industries. We then take our knowledge and experience to the world, sharing what we have learned to
inspire a global movement for industrial energy efficiency. We currently operate in Indonesia, China,
Mexico, Brazil and Morocco, five major industrial countries responsible for around 26% of the world's
energy consumption.

Morocco’s industrial sector profile
Historically, Morocco’s economy has been based on the agricultural sector, which presently
accounts for almost 40% of employment but contributes only 15% to the Kingdom’s GDP (see
Figure 1). Today, Morocco’s GDP is largely attributed to its service sector, which accounted for
56% of GDP in 2016. Moreover, the industrial sector employs 22% of Morocco’s workforce,
contributing almost 30% to the country’s economy (Castel, 2017).

LACK OF AWARENESS ABSENT REGULATIONS
BEHAVIOURAL ASPECTS

--- Page 17 ---

MOROCCO DIAGNOSTIC
What are the barriers limiting industrial energy efficiency in Morocco?
Such barriers were identified by conducting an extensive literature review and stakeholder interviews.
Publications by GIZ, GermanWatch, and the Netherland Enterprise Agency provided important inputs for
classifying the challenges Morocco is facing about increasing energy efficiency in the industry. Additionally,
expert interviews with representative from BMCI, Credit Agricole, Islamic Development Bank, CGEM, MorSEFF/
Africa Climate Solutions, Maroc PME, and IMANOR were conducted during fieldwork in Morocco. Each category
includes a different spectrum of barriers, which are important to take into consideration when trying to
implement energy efficiency projects in Morocco.
Lack of awareness
Working in the field of renewable energy and energy efficiency is still a quite new topic in Morocco. Hence,
local knowledge and experience is lacking and substantial groundwork continues to be completed.
Companies that might have a certain potential for energy savings through energy efficiency measures can
find it hard to identify such measures. Most business are poorly informed about the energy issue and possible
solutions. No assistance is being offered to companies for identifying possible energy savings opportunities.
Companies that have identified energy savings opportunities through, e.g. an energy audit, find challenges
in how to implement those audit recommendations, as overviews are missing regarding best available
technologies/equipment, businesses offering such services, and concerning financial support.
Often a certain company culture is prevailing which through established routines and procedures can easily
neglect the energy issue.
Organizational and behavioural aspects
Energy managers or persons responsible for energy in industrial operations are often not in a decision-
making position of the companies. Consequently, top management can easily neglect the energy issue.
These companies often observe a high turnover of executives. This pattern in combination with incentives
for immediate profits leads to focus on a short-term vision. As a result, energy efficiency often receives no
consideration in such short-term action plans, as usually savings from energy efficiency measures do not
become evident over a brief span.
Manufacturers are generally reluctant to deploy new equipment into their processes.
Absent regulation
The statutory framework and institutional infrastructure is lacking in regard to promoting industrial energy
efficiency. However, great strides have been made in establishing a dedicating agency for energy efficiency
(AMEE) and passing of the energy efficiency law 47-09 in 2011.
Only large companies have the capabilities to comply with regulations concerning energy savings. However,
there are no penalty mechanism in place punishing non-compliance.
Financial, tax, or other kind of incentives for consumer to invest in energy efficiency measures are missing.
Industrial Energy Accelerator | 17

--- Page 18 ---

MOROCCO DIAGNOSTIC
What solutions can address these barriers?
Supply chain
Suppliers are reluctant to introduce new products in the market without evidence indicating significant
demand for the new product.
The energy service market is seen as novel and insufficiently structured. The quality of services among
different service providers can vary significantly, making it difficult for consumers to ensure their requests
are being fulfilled to the best available standards.
The energy market has the tendency to fluctuate significantly (especially concerning liquid fuels) and creates,
thereby, high uncertainties concerning the development of the energy price.
Funding mechanism
The availability of financing options and mechanisms for investing in energy efficiency are not clearly
communicated to its respective target audience. Businesses are lacking information about available funding
and the organisation, and procedures seem often unclear to them.
Companies see themselves often confronted with complex, numerous, and demanding procedures to secure
the needed funding.
The sustainability of financial aid programmes is not always guaranteed. Funding is being made available
for a limited amount of time and once this support is no longer available, the demand for it declines as well.
SMEs are critical for creating demand as they make up most of the Moroccan economy. However, SMEs often
cannot access conventional debt financing as they lack certain prerequisites, such as providing collateral.
Funding does not always seem to be suitable in terms of timing and repayment.
ESCO related barriers
Services an ESCO can provide are mostly unknown to Moroccan enterprises. Therefore, the demand for ESCO
energy services is only limited.
Due to lack of awareness about the services and associated benefits that ESCOs can offer, commercial
banks have low trust in them and see investing in them as high risk. Therefore, other forms of financing for
ESCO activities are needed, e.g. the creation of a revolving energy efficiency fund, state financial and fiscal
incentives, or other measures to decrease the perceived risk.
A regulatory framework around ESCOs and their service offers is missing. Law 47-09 offers a first definition
of what an ESCO is but does not go any further.

Industrial Energy Accelerator established under the auspices of the SEforAll can support Morocco
to increase speed to, ultimately, tap the full potential of energy efficiency in the industry. Possible
solutions to before mentioned barriers are being presented according to the four pillar approach of
the Accelerator.
PILLAR NUMBER 1
Develop country specific industrial energy efficiency policy measures
Establishing new ESCO legislation
BARRIER SOLUTION DESCRIPTION
ESCO related ESCOs can provide a broad range Identifying and raising awareness about how
barriers of energy solutions can support ESCOs can support the uptake of energy efficiency
companies to achieve energy measures
savings
Assessing relevant ESCO activities
Understand best practice and outline policy options
for ESCO legislation
Assisting the Government to create and implement
new ESCO policy
Marketing and educational campaign to support
energy efficiency in SMEs and growth of ESCOs
