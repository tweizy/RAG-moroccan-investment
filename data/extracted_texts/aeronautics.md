Abstract: Given the high barriers to enter the aerospace industry, developing countries tend to use the needs of
aerospace manufacturer leaders for a competitive cost as main attracting factor. The objective of this study
is to investigate the attracting factors of Moroccan regions and country policy measures toward the
aerospace sector. A survey applied to all aerospace firms in Morocco is the main information source. The
existence and quality of industrial areas and labour force cost are considered as the main attraction forces by
all local subsidiaries.

In particular, proximity to key knowledge sources is
regarded as a key reason for the greater
competitiveness of some of the most successful
cities and regions in the world. While innovation is a
complex process which may require knowledge to
flow between firms and other actors (Lichtenthaler,
2005). Increasingly, this process is viewed as a
systemic undertaking - firms no longer innovate in
isolation but through a complex set of interactions
with others(Chesbrough, 2003).
