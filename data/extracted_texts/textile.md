This thematic report compiles insights collected between August and November 2022 and aims to provide insights into circularity trends
in the textile and apparel sector, how these may be relevant for Morocco, and how the industry can capitalize on its existing advantages
to grow the sector toward circular production.
The IFC commissioned New Narrative, a strategic communications consultancy with expertise in producing thought leadership content,
to conduct desktop research, analyses, and in-depth interviews with select stakeholders. Insights from this research are summarized in
the present publication. The report was written by Robert Carmichael and edited by David Line of New Narrative, and IFC’s Eleonore
Richardson and Txomin Goitia.
The team wishes to express our sincere gratitude to AMITH (Association Marocaine des Industries du Textile et de l’Habillement), brand repre-
sentatives, industry stakeholders, and IFC partners who generously contributed their time and insights.
This publication was made possible thanks to the support of the Government of Spain.

Box 1: What is circularity, and what does it require of the textiles industry?
A recent McKinsey report notes that circularity is one of 10 key themes for the fashion industry in 2022.43 But what is it and how
does it apply to the broader textiles industry?
Briefly, a circular economy is one in which waste is not produced in the first place —a clear improvement on the predominant
“take-make-dispose” model of production and consumption. As the Ellen MacArthur Foundation points out, three design-driven
principles underpin the circular economy:
• Eliminate waste and pollution.
• Circulate products and materials (at their highest value).
• Regenerate nature.44
At the heart of a circular economy is the transition to renewable energy and materials. In this way, a circular economy decouples
“economic activity from the consumption of finite resources,” building a resilient system that works for the world and tackles
some of humanity’s most pressing problems: climate change, biodiversity loss, waste, and pollution.45
Importantly, transforming to a circular economy is about far more than putting solar on factory rooftops or increasing the scale
of recycling of textile waste (though they are key, too). More fundamentally, it will require the industry to manufacture better
and with less primary materials.
Circular models of production will be essential, and will foster innovation in how the industry makes, dyes, and reuses materials.
These will also encourage investments in new technologies and machinery and will enable traceability throughout the product’s
life cycle.
Suppliers that can meet these requirements will find increasing numbers of brands keen to partner with them, as those brands
seek to address their own challenges—not the least ones that require collaboration and a shared vision along the value chain.

2. The EU’s drive for change
2.1 A SHARPER FOCUS Many more changes are set to come, driven in large part by
the European Union, the world’s leading importer of apparel
Around the world, some of the necessary changes are by value,14 and whose Green Deal (see box 2.1) is central to
underway—though, as Magruder notes, circularity remains in its ambition to make Europe the world’s first carbon-neutral
its infancy everywhere. continent by 2050. The Green Deal’s focus on sustainability
will have profound implications for numerous industries,
including textiles.
Box 2: The EU’s Green Deal
The language of the Green Deal, which was launched in 2019, is direct: “climate change and environmental degradation,” it states,
“are an existential threat to Europe and the world”.15 That realization lies behind the EU’s shift from voluntary to mandatory
measures in numerous areas in recent years.
The Green Deal’s goal is to ensure the EU will become “a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy” that will, among
other things, generate no net GHG emissions by 2050 and will decouple economic growth from the use of resources.16
In other words, the EU is demanding circularity, and of crucial importance is that exporters to the world’s third-largest economy
(after the US and China, as measured by gross domestic product [GDP]17) will have to adhere to its evolving rules on sustainability
and circularity.
The Green Deal is a broad canvas that covers a range of areas including climate, energy, environment and oceans, transport,
agriculture, and industry, and is expected to bring numerous benefits (see figure 2). Several of these will directly affect how the
textiles industry operates.

In the nearer term—and also of great relevance to the global textiles industry —the 27-nation bloc has adopted proposals to
ensure that its policies on climate, energy, transport, and taxation are designed to cut GHG emissions by at least 55 percent by
2030 from the 1990’s levels.18
The EU’s 2020 Circular Economy Action Plan and its 2022 Strategy for Sustainable and Circular Textiles (see below) are elements
within the broader Green Deal and of profound importance for the textiles industry.

also change their supply chain. So, in the longer run, they have
an interest in finding inputs beyond traditional suppliers—
perhaps focusing more on Africa.”
The industry, he adds, will likely be confronted with additional
due diligence requirements. And, he notes, reliance on fast
fashion “is not a very sustainable model,” while buyers and
brands will need assurances of improved controls along the
supply chain.
Additionally, Morocco will need to strengthen its protection
of intellectual property for brands —a particular concern
for US companies. Indeed, the inadequate protection of
intellectual property rights was flagged in 2022 by the Office
of the United States Trade Representative as one of its main
concerns in respect of trade and investment in Morocco.41
“The challenge will be for Morocco to target a number of
textile sectors where they have a comparative advantage or
the potential for one,” the Brussels-based source says, adding
that this could be in the realm of, for instance, textiles for the
automotive or medical sectors. Fast fashion, though, is less
likely to be a successful focus given the EU’s push to ensure a
more sustainable textile industry.
While Morocco is incorporating circularity into its broad
economic focus, it has yet to succeed in creating what is
needed in terms of circularity, including formalizing traceable
waste and collection schemes.
To that end, stakeholders should reach out to see how the EU
can help. The EU delegation in Morocco says when it comes
to the textiles sector, its office has been asked for assistance
on just one project—though it is ready to provide support to
help the Kingdom set up mechanisms on the recycling side,
for instance, as well as for related aspects like reporting.

4. Conclusion
Although these are early days, it is clear that—for some
markets at least—the era of the textiles industry’s hugely
wasteful, linear production model is starting to come to an end.
Driven by the EU via its Green Deal and related legislation,
and with other markets likely to follow in due course, this
change means the textiles industry will increasingly need to
embrace circular and sustainable production models.
The EU’s goal is that, by 2030, all textiles “placed on the EU
market are durable, repairable and recyclable, to a great extent

• Building a sustainable, state-of-the-art industry locally
that provides upstream elements like yarn, fabric, printing,
and dyeing, and that offers traceability for brands.
Improving the availability of local backwards linkages
would also help Morocco meet the PEM zone’s rules-of-
origin requirements for preferential access to the EU.
• Moving away from fast fashion and the CMT model that
sees fabric imported from abroad to a model that instead

FPP.
17

--- Page 22 ---

Although these steps will take significant effort by Morocco’s
textile industry, the Kingdom is in a strong position to
succeed, for the following reasons:
• The government and industry are acutely aware that
change is coming, and that the opportunity is Morocco’s
to seize.
• There is a clear sense of urgency about the need to act.
• Its competitors are in the same boat, yet few enjoy the
advantages Morocco does, not the least its proximity to
the EU.
Acting to retain and expand access into the EU market is not
the only reason to take the initiative. The industry is of vital
national importance and building a circular economy for the
textiles ecosystem would also create more jobs and build new
value chains.
Moreover, lessons learned in the textile industry could be
applied to other parts of the country’s economy to further
expand the Kingdom’s access to the EU. And, of course,
creating carbon-neutral industries would help Morocco to cut
its carbon footprint, with concomitant benefits for population
health, the economy, and the environment.
In summary, achieving true circularity requires that Morocco
look at the entire textiles value chain, from design to sourcing
to disposal, and including waste at different stages, to ensure
the industry can meet the EU’s requirements. Although there
is little time to spare, the good news is that Morocco can
achieve what is needed in time—and emerge stronger and
more competitive than many of its rivals.
