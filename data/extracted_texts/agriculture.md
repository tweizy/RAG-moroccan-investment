PREFACE
In November 2018, at an international conference, the European Training Foundation (ETF) initiated
a dialogue on how global trends such as digitalisation, globalisation, migration and climate change are
impacting the education and employment systems in developing and transition economies and on how
such countries can respond. The conference – Skills for the Future: Managing Transition – concluded
that monitoring and understanding evolving skills demand is an essential component in how countries
should equip their societies for the future.
The ETF and its partners found that countries could best anticipate emerging skills needs by
combining both traditional methods of data collection and analysis with newer approaches made
increasingly possible through data science.
The ETF commissioned the present study as part of its follow-up to the conclusions reached at the
conference. It is one of several surveys, studies and analyses ongoing and pursued by ETF experts in
skills demand, all aimed at gathering and analysing information on evolving skills needs. It investigates
how various drivers of change – principally technological – impact skills demand in the agri-food
sector, and how education and training will need to adapt to meet those needs. The choice of the
sector was based on several considerations. First, in many countries, including Morocco, the
agricultural sector employs a substantial share of the workforce, both directly in the fields and
indirectly, in food processing, for example. Second, agri-food is typically considered to be a labour-
intensive but low-skilled sector, with limited use of advanced technologies. Accordingly, the take-up of
new technologies such as precision agriculture techniques may well have disruptive consequences for
skills demand and employment numbers in the sector. Third, the use of new technologies in the agri-
food sector has important implications for environmental sustainability.
This study concentrates on changing skills needs and documents changes in the occupational
composition of jobs resulting from technological change. In other words, it looks at how the skill
content of jobs is changing. It does not assess potential changes in the volume of labour or skills
demand or number of workers in the sector resulting from technological change. The focus is very
much on identifying the skills which people working in the agri-food sector will increasingly need to
acquire. The study also provides information on how companies adapt to technological change and
acquire the associated skills. As such, it gives an indication of how supply of skills is keeping pace
with technological advances in the sector. Ultimately, the aim of the study is to raise awareness about
changes in skills demand and stimulate discussion among policy-makers and practitioners in the field
so that the findings can inform the adaptation of education and training provision, for example in
curricula, teaching and qualifications.
The study is one of a series of studies that the ETF has been implementing in its partner countries
focusing on economic sectors that present niches of innovation and potential for further development.
It is based on a new methodological approach which combines traditional research methods (desk
research, data analysis and interviews) with the use of big data text mining techniques. The use of big
data analysis is gaining traction in skills research. Despite some limitations (e.g. coverage,
representativeness and applicability), it provides new insights as well as real-time information on
recent trends and complements more traditional approaches to skills anticipation. By using a mixed
methodology, the research can offer insights that might otherwise be missed. The result is a
consistent set of findings corroborated by different research tools on emerging trends related to
technology and skills.

Fondazione Giacomo Brodolini and Erre Quadro have been working with the ETF to conduct a series
of sector studies in several countries. They have been directed by the ETF’s team of experts and
assisted by international and national experts as well as stakeholders in each respective country.
This study was carried out between June 2020 and November 2020. This report was drafted by
Riccardo Apreda, Liga Baltina, Riccardo Campolmi, Chiara Fratalia and Terence Hogarth with inputs
from the national expert Rachid Mrabet and was extensively commented on by ETF experts
Francesca Rosso, Ummuhan Bardak and Anastasia Fetsi. The report also benefitted from inputs from
a wider set of ETF experts, including Romain Boitard, Xavier Matheu de Cortada, Abdelaziz Jaouani
and Michael Graham.
The report documents all steps of the research and presents the findings in a detailed manner. This is
because the ETF wants to raise awareness of all stakeholders in the partner countries, be they
researchers, practitioners or policy-makers, of the changing skills needs at the sectoral level. The
findings are designed not only to raise awareness but also to provide food for thought, especially in
relation to the ability of education and training systems to face changing skills demands and prepare
workers for the jobs of the future. Shorter and more targeted papers (e.g. policy briefs, infographics, a
methodological note) are published in parallel. Further discussion papers reflecting on the different
case studies implemented across countries will follow at a later stage after the full series of cases has
been completed.
Last but not least, the ETF would like to thank all the public and private institutions, individuals and
companies in Morocco (see list in Annex) for sharing information and opinions on the topic, and
actively participating in the ETF’s online workshops organised in June and November 2020. This
report would not have been possible without their significant contributions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In many countries, the agricultural sector is important, accounting for a substantial share of overall
employment both directly and indirectly through its links to food processing and food distribution. This
report focuses on the agri-food sector in Morocco. Activities that take place in the agri-food sector in
Morocco are those which involve farming and the sale of products from Moroccan farms to final
consumers. As such, it involves the processing of produce from Moroccan farms into food for sale.
This will include, for example, the processing of Moroccan-grown sugar beet into sugar, the
production of orange juice from oranges, and the pressing of olives to make olive oil. It thereby
includes value-adding activities related to agriculture. It forms an ecosystem whereby agricultural
producers are interlinked with food processing ones. The agri-food sector is not readily identified
using the statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community (NACE –
Nomenclature statistique des activités économiques dans la Communauté européenne). It includes
agriculture (NACE Division 01) and parts of the food processing sector (classified under NACE
Divisions 10 and 11) but excludes forestry (NACE Division 02) and fishing (NACE Division 03) since
they require a completely different set of skills to those of farming. From an occupational point of
view, the focus has been on those job profiles and skills which are likely to be affected by ongoing
and future technological change. The overall aim of the study has been to identify as far as possible
the sector’s emerging skills needs.
Agriculture in Morocco has accounted for around 12% of gross domestic product (GDP) over the past
five years and around 33% of employment. Low productivity and low incomes drive people out of
agriculture, leading to falling employment in the sector. Employment fell from 45% of total
employment in 2006 to 38% in 2019 but remains much higher than the share of value added it
produces. Agri-food as a whole is particularly important in rural areas. It is estimated that currently
around 4 million rural inhabitants are employed in agriculture. On the other hand, the food processing
industry has a more limited but increasing workforce, as around 141 000 people work in the sector at
the national level. The agri-food sector accounts for around 21% of total exports. The sector plays a
key role in rural development and food security in Morocco. It is also a sector which faces major
challenges, not least soil erosion and degradation and drought which blight agriculture. There are
also large disparities in the performance of large farms compared with their smaller counterparts.
Given its economic importance and the nature of the challenges it faces, the agricultural sector has
been subject, over the last decade, to policy making which has addressed productivity, employment,
and the climate change/green agenda. One of the most important public policy interventions has
been the Green Morocco Plan (Plan Maroc Vert) 2008–2020. Launched in 2008, it was designed to
support the development of the agricultural sector by fostering closer links between farms and
industry, and stimulating the formation of cooperatives between farms. Given the dominance of small
farms – 70% of farmers own less than five hectares – cooperatives have been regarded as an
effective means of developing the technical and managerial skills the sector needs, along with
improved access to finance, modern production systems, and marketing. The plan – which drew to a
close in 2020 – was expected to create over one million jobs and triple the income of rural
inhabitants. There are other initiatives that have focused more on the agri-food industry, such as the
National Pact for Industrial Emergence (Pacte national pour l’émergence industrielle, 2009–2015) to

support sector growth by improving the agri-food infrastructure via agropoles1; the Industrial
Acceleration Plan (2014–2020); and the Contract Programme 2017–2022 for the agri-food industry.
In spring 2020, a new strategy for agriculture – Génération Green – was launched. The new strategy,
which covers the period to 2030, will build on the achievements of the Green Morocco Plan to further
consolidate growth and social improvements in the sector. It focuses particularly on human capital
development, increasing the revenues of farmers through investments, and widening access to social
protection for workers in the sector (the Decent Work Agenda). The strategy is also intended to make
the sector more attractive to young people either as an employment destination or a focus for their
entrepreneurship. It also continues to support the creation of new agricultural organisations/
cooperatives and the adoption of new technologies in the production process.
Agriculture, considered part of the agri-food sector, is a sector that has relied on traditional
technologies and associated skills for decades. Now, the challenges imposed by global trade and
competition, climate change and sustainable farming, changing consumer behaviour and diffusion of
affordable new technologies have all resulted in the sector undergoing a series of radical changes
across the globe. The Moroccan agri-foods sector is no exception. The capacity of the agri-food
sector to be a driver of growth is dependent on it possessing, among other things, the human capital
to facilitate the shift to more effective, environmentally sustainable production systems, and improved
marketing and distribution which will afford better access to international markets. This is where the
current study has a role to play. It provides an assessment of current and emerging skills demands in
the agri-food sector in Morocco resulting from the various changes that the sector is undergoing.
Research method
The study used a mixed methods approach, using the following:
■ analysis of reports and statistics which reveal something about the evolving demand for skills in
the agri-food sector in Morocco;
■ big data analysis employing text mining techniques to capture data on emerging technological
change (and the factors underlying that change) and associated skills needs from a variety of
sources (e.g. patents, scientific papers and policy papers);
■ interviews with companies from the sector, bilateral meetings, focus group and a validation
workshop with key stakeholders.
The background analysis – based on a review of the literature and analysis of official statistics –
provides an overview of employment, innovation and skills developments in the agri-food sector. The
text mining element provides information on technological trends and associated skills needs which
are not readily captured in reports, and statistics tend to focus on past rather than future trends.
The interviews with key stakeholders and companies build on the big data analysis to explore in
more depth the types of technologies being introduced into the sector and the skills needs they give
rise to. Importantly, the interviews also reveal much about the preparedness of the supply side to
keep pace with the changing demand for skills.
1 Agropoles offer various services to producers and are specifically designed to support the value chains in
value creation and export growth.

Drivers of change
To derive a list of technologies requires an analysis of the drivers of change. Big data analysis,
combined with insights from desk research and interviews, identified the following drivers of change
in Morocco’s agri-food sector:
■ Globalisation has had a positive impact on innovation and the modernisation of production
processes. But increasing international trade in agri-food products and reduced tariffs have also
resulted in the abandonment of some product markets because of price competition from other
countries.
■ Regulation, government incentives, and taxation. National and international rules and standards
affect the agri-food business, from farm production (e.g. the regulation of pesticide use) to
market distribution (e.g. where goods need to be kept at a certain temperature). Additionally,
government programmes, such as the Green Morocco Plan, Génération Green, and agropoles,
have supported the development of the sector. Finally, taxation and trade tariffs also affect
competitiveness.
■ Aridity is a problem. During 2018 and 2019, Morocco has been hit by severe droughts which
have affected both production quantity and quality. Related to this, climate change, which will
likely worsen water scarcity, efficient water management (as a response to aridity and climate
change) and environmental sustainability (e.g. issues related to energy production and waste
management/reuse) are further driving change in the sector.
■ Crop improvement. The development of new varieties of plants increases their resistance to
water stress, disease and pest infestation. Thus, crop improvement is becoming more important
in the sector.
■ Technological innovation, mainly related to improving efficiency, reducing costs and raising
productivity levels, has been increasing since 2008 thanks to government measures such as the
Green Morocco Plan.
■ Quality, identity preservation, and consumer awareness (national and international). Improving
the quality of products (e.g. organic agriculture, agroecology, and preservation of food identity)
and of processes (e.g. traceability), the development of new niche products, and the shift
towards increased food processing is becoming increasingly important in order to compete in the
international market, satisfy emerging customers’ needs, and capture a relatively high-value
segment of global supply chains. A related theme is that of achieving a structured value chain to
improve controls and quality along the chain from production to distribution and reduce the
widespread presence of the informal market.
■ Change in the tastes of Moroccans. Shifts in the lifestyles and consumer preferences of
Moroccans, especially new demands for quality and clean and safe products (with less or no use
of chemical products), affect the agri-food sector, which potentially opens up new market
opportunities. Improving sustainability requires investments and innovation in new products and
associated business models.
■ Impact of Covid-19. The pandemic has forced some companies to re-think their product offering
as well as speed up the use of some digital technologies. Despite facing difficulties because of
Covid-19, the agri-food sector has fared relatively well to date.

Emerging technologies
The various drivers of change have implications for the types of technologies used in the agri-food
sector. The analysis of patent data suggests that innovations in irrigation systems, biochemistry and
pesticides and fertilisers have been relatively commonplace (as indicated by the relatively large
number of patents filed) and are likely to bring about future change in the agri-food sector. There are
also a range of other technologies/technological processes which the text mining analysis indicates
as being important to the sector in Morocco. These are:
■ data acquisition and analysis
■ solar thermal devices (solar collector, heating devices, heat carrier medium)
■ chemical separation techniques (flash and column chromatography)
■ telemetry for reducing energy consumption
■ harvesting machines for precision farming
■ image acquisition
■ Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
■ microwave reactor
■ wireless technologies
■ pumps for irrigation systems
■ drive mechanisms
■ preventive maintenance
■ sealing
■ valves (isolation valve, control valve)
■ material treatment
■ hydraulics systems
■ information technology (IT) systems development
■ genetics, biochemistry, biotechnologies
■ robotic arms
■ automation
■ automatic measurement devices for packing and transportation
■ chemistry and green chemistry
■ mechanical press
■ raw material extrusion
■ sensors (biosensors, remote sensors, microsensors)
■ nanotechnologies.
These are all technologies which will become more commonplace in agri-food in the short to medium
term. If these technologies are to be adopted, the workforce will need to acquire the skills to operate
them.
Identifying new skills needs
The capacity of the agri-food sector to obtain maximum benefits from the new technologies listed
above depends on the availability of skills to facilitate their introduction, use and maintenance. To
identify the skills attached to the technologies, a further round of text mining was undertaken using
two online databases which contain detailed information on occupational skills profiles: (i) the
multilingual classification of European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO)
database, and (ii) the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) database from the USA. As these
two databases do not contain emerging (future) jobs or new skills needs, Wikipedia was also used as
it contains this information.
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 7

The results of the analysis reveal the jobs which are likely to be most affected by technological
change. These are:
■ technical or technology-related occupations, such as engineers and technicians in various
technological areas, especially those related to the value chain, quality control, maintenance,
and energy efficiency; data analysts and computer programmers; agriculture-related
professionals such as agronomists, soil and plant scientists, irrigation specialists and food
scientists; certain categories of machine operators and skilled craft workers; and agricultural and
transport labourers;
■ business services and related occupations, such as renewable energy consultants and
representatives; food managers; different types of production team leaders, such as agronomic
crops, horticulture and fruit; and horticulture production managers.
The analysis shows that the professional and associate professional occupations most likely to be
affected by technological change are water plant technicians, biochemical engineers, sensor
engineering technicians, bioengineers, water engineers, fluid power engineers and wastewater
engineers and technicians. It is not just professional and technician jobs that will be affected, but also
medium-skilled occupations related to day-to-day farming such as pump operators. The impact of
technological change will increasingly affect people working at all levels in the sector.
The new skills needed to master the interface with new technologies will also affect the role of more
traditional jobs in agri-food such as agronomists and food specialists. While the set of skills listed by
ESCO for that occupation range from using pesticides to developing irrigation strategies, the
information collected from the interviews with key stakeholders and employers revealed that
agronomists will have to possess a wider range of knowledge than before, including, for example,
precision agriculture techniques (e.g. monitoring sensors and interpreting data). Also, the skills
related to the ongoing changes towards diversification, quality improvement, exports to foreign
markets, and upgrading along the value chain will reshape existing profiles in a range of production,
management and sales jobs.
Entirely new professions will emerge as well, typically at the boundary between disciplines. These
new jobs include, for example, those related to the new niche markets that will emerge, such as
environmental economist or nutritionist engineer (expert in technological processes but also in
consumer preferences and habits). Other emerging specialisations are those related to the
improvement and control of quality and processes such as metrologist or manufacturing and
packaging managers.
Data mining analysis and company interviews reveal that even if digitalisation is disruptive, resulting
in some roles being substituted by automation, there is the potential to upskill those workers who
may be at risk from this development. In this way, the jobs of existing workers can be retained.
To sum up, the evidence indicates that the majority of workers will need to possess a wider range of
skills than in the past as a consequence of the technological changes which are already coming on
stream and which are likely to be more commonplace in the future. In particular, the interviews with
companies pointed to high-level skills needs encompassing multidisciplinary competences, and the
ability to interact with people from different disciplinary or professional backgrounds. This potentially
poses a number of challenges for those responsible for developing the agri-food sector’s future
supply of skills.

Responding to change: the views of stakeholders
Desk research (review of various policy reports, collation of official statistics, and big data analysis)
was the first step in looking at the demand for skills. Interviews with key stakeholders and companies
on their experiences of technological change and the emerging skills needs were used as the second
step to assess how the new skills are obtained by companies. The results from the interviews with
key agri-food stakeholders revealed the following findings.
■ All the sector representatives confirmed that the sector is undergoing a period of advanced
technological change as outlined by the big data analysis.
■ There are various factors which may constrain growth in the agri-food sector, from the high
capital investments needed to acquire new technologies – which are out of reach for smaller
companies/farms – to the shortage of skills needed to manage ongoing changes.
■ Recruiting people with the skills needed to adapt to technological change can prove difficult for
four reasons: the relatively low attractiveness of the sector compared with positions in the public
sector that require similar levels of skill; many highly skilled workers (including engineers) leave
the country to work abroad; in some regions, agri-food establishments are located far from
population centres; and there is a varying level of supply coming from the local education and
training system.
■ Strategies to recruit people with the right skills range from recruiting new graduates from
universities after an internship period, to recruitment through head-hunters and also using job
advertisements. For smaller businesses, word of mouth is also a solution.
■ Many companies are training their workforces (upskilling and reskilling) so that future skills
needs will be met. This is an investment for both companies and society but the cost of which is
carried mainly by the employers.
■ More training/education centres dedicated to agri-food are needed if future skills needs are to be
met. At the moment, individual businesses need to develop the skills they need in-house.
Improving skills anticipation
The use of a mixed methods approach – combining desk research with data mining techniques and
interviews with stakeholders and companies – has provided more nuanced information on emerging
skills needs. It has identified the key technologies that will drive skills demand over the short to
medium term, and the variety of skills which will be increasingly in demand. The results can guide
future training provision so that skills shortages which might constrain growth can be avoided.
This is not the end of the process. The report raises questions for further research, such as
information on the supply of skills (its quality and volume) and the scale of demand, whether that
demand is likely to be met, and the impact of unmet skills on the sector and the economy. By
identifying the specific skills which will affect a variety of jobs in the future, it is now possible to feed
this information into skills forecasting and skills foresight exercises, and into the design of employer
skills surveys. The latter can help identify the volume of demand for specific occupations/jobs/skills,
and the actual combinations of skills which are required within those jobs. It can also provide an
indication of whether supply is keeping pace with demand.
Given the high speed of technological advances in some sectors such as agri-food, it is necessary to
periodically repeat the analysis carried out in this study so that an updated list of specific skills needs
is available.

Final conclusions
Based on the analysis contained in the report, the following policy conclusions emerged.
1. There is a need to adopt an integrated vision and push for greater convergence between
agriculture (upstream) and food processing (downstream). They are managed by different
institutions at a national level, but if a vision for the agri-food sector is to be fully developed and
realised, there will need to be much more convergence/integration between those authorities
responsible for the constituent parts of the agri-food sector.
2. The major challenges facing the agri-food sector are clear enough in the report: manage climate
change, increase productivity, capture high value added segments of global markets, and
increase the supply of skills the sector needs to name but a few. Meeting these challenges will
require increased investments in research and development.
3. There is a need to support the transfer of new technologies to farms of all sizes through sectoral
associations, cooperatives, and/or public institutions such as the Office National du Conseil
Agricole. It will be important to demonstrate the benefits of investing in new technologies such as
clearly signalling the economic benefits to be gained from, for example, using solar power to dry
food. In some respects, what is important here is changing mindsets, i.e. persuading producers
to be more open to innovations of one kind or another, given that the failure to change may
ultimately threaten the viability of their current businesses.
4. The aggregation of small farmers was one of the key elements of the Green Morocco Plan. This
direction should be pursued even further to promote different types of collective organisations.
For example, the economic interest group (groupement d’intérêt économique) can play a
substantial role in regional development, as they put together traditional units that otherwise
would not be able to ensure quality. However, they should be provided with more capacity in
terms of number of experts, and with incentives to compensate for higher costs than in the
informal market.
5. Human capital development needs to take place simultaneously with technological change as
the two elements are inter-dependent. Accordingly, there is a need for improved information
about and diagnosis of skills and training needs. The current study has made an important step
here in demonstrating the information which can be used to undertake such a diagnosis. This
type of skills intelligence needs to be converted into a process for identifying training needs.
6. In considering how training and education needs relevant to the sector can be satisfied, there is
a need to think about innovative, efficient and effective means of delivery. Online delivery tools
are important here. More practical (e.g. laboratory) activities are also relevant, especially to
complement higher education curricula. But it is not just about the means of delivery. There is
content to think of as well. For instance, Morocco wants to increase the volume of its exports
which, in turn, points to training and skills needs related to international cooperation.
7. Interviews pointed out that the main gap in human resources is not at university level, but is
linked to vocational education and training (VET) graduates, due to a limited capacity of the
education system to provide enough technicians with the appropriate competences coupled with
practical training. The ability to attract and retain young graduates is another key issue.
8. To overcome the shortage of skilled professionals, a good practice that could be further explored
and possibly mainstreamed is that of sectoral federations creating specialised institutions for
continuing training. An example of this is the agreement between the Fédération nationale de la
minoterie and the Office de la formation professionnelle et de la promotion du travail that
enabled the Institut de formation de l’industrie meunière to train more than 400 technicians
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 10

specialised in milling activities. The advantage is in-depth knowledge of the sector and its
specific needs.
9. Green technologies, biological or organic farming, agroecology, and sustainable development
are new models for agri-food which can become profitable niches for Morocco, with benefits for
both the market proposition and job creation. For example, renewable energy has been indicated
alongside irrigation of wider portions of land as two main sources of new employment in the
country. The Department of Agriculture of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries could revise
education programmes to adapt to these emerging niches.
10. One of the main challenges for the future is to enhance and diversify local products and, at the
same time, improve the quality of production to attract more customers, at national and
international levels. Acting at the value chain level seems an efficient way to increase
employment both in the agricultural sector and in all the other economic sectors that interact with
it: industry, energy, craft, design and marketing. However, at present, not all value chains are
well organised; in these cases, issues should be tackled to address the lack of organisation so
that large companies, cooperatives and institutions can support the aggregation of small players
and transfer know-how, fostering the adoption of technologies, new management models,
access to funding, and quality control and certification. A related issue is that the informal market
impacts negatively on the more innovative enterprises, pushing for lower prices and lower
quality.
11. New vocational schools dedicated to specific value chains could be developed to train
professionals in specific competences, especially those related to higher value added products,
or to promote research and development activities.
12. Last but not least, enhancing continuing training, reskilling and upskilling helps adaptability of
workers to rapidly change skills and to give them tools to transit to new job opportunities. In this,
cooperation with the private sector (with the establishment of specific public–private
partnerships, as is already happening in some sectors) is key, together with the reinforcement of
work-based learning practices and internships.

1. INTRODUCTION
The pace of technological advance in the world today often appears daunting. Speculative
predictions point to huge swathes of jobs being replaced by automation in the guise of robots,
artificial intelligence routines, and so on. In reality, the impact of technological change on
employment is often much less sensational. Some jobs will be lost as a consequence of
technological change – this has always been the case – but other new jobs will be created too.
These new jobs may, as yet, be unknown to us. Thirty years ago, many of the jobs available today
would have been beyond people’s imagination at the time. But if advantage is to be taken of
technological change, then an indication is required of types of jobs and the skills they will give rise to
in the future. Technological change will only take root in a country if the skills are in place that will
lead to its introduction in the first instance, and then for it to be used as effectively and efficiently as
possible so that its value to the economy is optimised. The danger of not introducing new
technologies is that an economy, or sector, will fall behind that in competitor countries.
Anticipating the skills needs associated with technological change faces two key challenges. First,
the pace of technological change is such that predicting its future trajectory poses a number of
problems. Second, if there is uncertainty about technological change, this makes it even more
difficult to identify emerging skills needs. It is worth mentioning at this point that the pace of
technological change in practice is often slower than some commentators would have one believe. It
typically requires relatively large-scale investments by companies who, understandably, are often
cautious with regard to the likely returns. This tends to slow the pace of diffusion. Nevertheless,
official statistics and surveys which capture information on fixed capital investments by companies
and the skills needs resulting from technological change are sometimes dated by the time they are
published. Often, they provide information on what the situation was a few years ago. Policy-makers
ideally want much more up-to-date information. Even if the pace of technological change is slower
than sometimes predicted, current information is still a necessity for the policy-maker. This is where
the approach adopted in the current study pays dividends. It makes the most of the historical data,
which provides robust estimates of, for instance, changes in the occupational and job structure of
employment, but marries it with more up-to-date information obtained from the use of text mining
techniques which gather almost real-time data on technological change and associated emerging
skills needs.
Technological change is pervasive. It has the capacity to affect all sectors and all jobs in one way or
another. It has the capacity to be disruptive even in those sectors which are relatively labour-
intensive. This is why the agri-food sector is of interest. It is a sector which is relatively labour-
intensive but subject to major technological changes designed to address key challenges such as the
need to increase crop resilience and better manage water resources. It is also a sector which
accounts for a relatively large share of employment in countries such as Morocco. With this in mind,
the current study addresses, among other things, the following:
■ the drivers of technological change in agri-food, and an assessment of the technologies which
are currently being introduced or which are likely to be increasingly introduced in the years
ahead;
■ the impact of non-technological drivers of change – e.g. the need for sustainability, regulation,
global trade patterns, and changing consumer habits – which are also likely to have some
bearing on the future demand for skills;

--- Page 16 ---

■ the skills demand which will result from the increased take-up of various forms of technological
change;
■ the supply side’s capacity to keep pace with the skills needs associated with technological
change (i.e. the extent to which the education and training system will be able to meet emerging
skills needs).
The report is organised as follows: Chapter 2 sets out the study’s analytical framework and
methodological approach. A more detailed explanation of the methodology has been published
separately by the ETF. In Chapter 3, an overview of the agri-food sector in Morocco is provided
based on a literature review and secondary analysis of official employment statistics. It provides the
contextual background relating to the sector and also operation of the labour market in Morocco.
Based on the text mining exercise, Chapter 4 analyses the main drivers of change in agri-food in
Morocco and the technological changes which are beginning to take root. It further explores how
these are likely to influence future skills needs. Using data derived from the text mining, combined
with information obtained from the in-depth interviews with key stakeholders and selected innovative
companies, Chapter 5 provides information on emerging skills needs and their impact on
occupational job profiles. Chapter 6 outlines how the companies have responded to observed
changes to meet their emerging skills needs, including their strategies involving education and
training providers and research centres. The chapter finishes with a final word on the findings.
The report also includes a list of key stakeholder institutions in Morocco who were consulted at
various stages (see Annex), a glossary of various terms and concepts used throughout the report,
and a list of references.

2. METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH
The purpose of this study is to understand the drivers of change affecting the agri-food sector in
Morocco, ascertain the technological changes which are either taking place or about to take place,
and identify the resulting skills needs. The study is about understanding the links between
technological change and skills demand so that policy-makers can better respond to emerging skills
needs. The initial research questions that provided the framework of the study are shown in Box 2.1.
BOX 2.1 SPECIFIC RESEARCH QUESTIONS
Questions about the state of development in the analysed sector
1. What is the relationship of the selected subsector to the whole sector and the broader
economy, e.g. production, employment and export?
2. What are the main drivers of change currently shaping the sector, e.g. trade, global
value chains, new technologies, digital tools greening of the economy and climate
change?
3. What has driven/generated innovation in this part of the sector and does it have the
potential to become an influence on the rest of the sector?
Questions about the empirical evidence on the changes occurring in the sector
4. What are the ongoing changes observed in the sector in terms of production, storage,
marketing, business practices, labour and skills utilisation?
5. What are the main occupational profiles used in the sector? Has the content of some
occupations evolved as a result of the above changes in the sector, and if so, how?
6. Which new tasks and functions have emerged in the jobs and/or occupations in this
sector? Which old ones have disappeared?
7. What are the differences in the job profiles of this innovative sector? What changes are
observed in the profiles of new recruitments and job vacancies published?
8. What is the impact of these changes on labour and skills demands in the sector? Do
changes require higher levels of the same skills or completely new sets of skills from
workers?
9. How do these changes affect ‘skills utilisation’ and working conditions in the sector,
e.g. salary, contracts, working hours and formality?
10. How do businesses meet their new skills needs (new hiring, retraining, etc.)? Are there
initiatives for cooperation of companies with education and training providers?
Questions about policy implications
11. Do technology, innovation and other changes push countries towards a higher added
value and integration in the global value chain? Are skills contributing to this shift? If
so, how? Are there skills gaps that impede developments?
12. Are there any spill over effects from the changes in the broader sector overall? What
context-specific and general lessons can be derived from these studies?
13. Are changes and innovation in the sector causing education and training to respond
and adapt to industry needs?

2.1 Defining the agri-food sector
Activities that take place in the agri-food sector in Morocco are those which involve farming and the
sale of products from Moroccan farms to final consumers. As such, it involves the processing of
produce from Moroccan farms into food for sale. This will include, for example, the processing of
Moroccan-grown sugar beet into sugar, the production of orange juice from oranges, and the
pressing of olives to make olive oil. It forms an ecosystem whereby agricultural producers are
interlinked with food processing. The agri-food sector is not readily identified using NACE (the
statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community – see Glossary for more
details). It includes agriculture (NACE Division 01) and parts of the food processing sector (NACE
Divisions 10 and 11).
The Venn diagram in Figure 2.1 shows the interlinkages between the agriculture and food processing
sectors with the shaded areas depicting the agri-food sector.
FIGURE 2.1 VISUALISATION OF THE MOROCCAN AGRI-FOOD SECTOR
The present study encompasses all food types coming from farming activities, from cereals and fruit
and vegetables, to meat and dairy products, and all company types, including small, traditional,
family-run activities, large and often highly mechanised farms, and cooperatives. The study does not
include subsistence agriculture as it is used to satisfy the need of producers and therefore not
destined for commercialisation. It also does not include fishing, because although it is related to
human nutrition, its workers must possess a different and distinctive set of skills.
It is important to note that a substantial part of the strategies to develop the sectors are related to the
logic of creating a business ecosystem. The Green Morocco Plan 2008–2020 has certainly boosted
the agri-food sector, mostly on the production (agricultural) side, while Génération Green will focus
on enhancing the value of production. Moreover, the creation of agropoles2 has built a bridge
2 Agropoles offer various services to producers and are specifically designed to support the value chains in
value creation and export growth.

between agriculture and the food processing industry, fostering a more integrated approach linking
the upstream and downstream processes in agri-food.
2.2 Step-by-step approach to data collection and processing
Given the need for the study to be forward-looking, a mixed methods approach has been used,
combining desk research and data analysis with data mining techniques and interviews with
stakeholders and companies (Box 2.2).
BOX 2.2 STEPS FOLLOWED IN THE STUDY’S MIXED METHODS APPROACH
1. Use of well-established methodologies derived from social science, including:
▪ a literature review of the agri-food sector in Morocco, and
▪ secondary analysis of employment and skills data, in particular in the sector.
2. Big data analysis in relation to the agri-food sector in Morocco:
▪ text mining applied to a large volume of documents such as patents or scientific
papers connected to agri-food to identify the upcoming technologies and other
drivers of change, and
▪ comparing and matching the list of relevant technologies extracted from text
mining to the related occupations and skills listed by the occupational databases
of ESCO* and O*NET*, by using semantic matching algorithms.
3. In-depth interviews with companies and key stakeholders in the agri-food sector and
focus groups to verify and refine the results of the two previous steps.
* See Glossary for more details.
The first step of the study involved reviewing the literature on the innovation, employment and skills
pool in Morocco. This was followed by a description of the agri-food sector. This contextual analysis
demonstrates that the capacity of the sector to introduce the latest technologies does not rest only
with skills policies, but also with obtaining investment capital, having links with research institutes,
and offering relatively good jobs to attract those with the necessary skills.
The second step is that of text mining, a technique that allows computers to extract, discover or
organise relevant information from large collections of different written resources. The textual
documentation produced by industries, institutions, research centres and the like offers a vast
amount of information which is often scattered across many sources, the sheer volume of which
makes it impossible to collate and analyse through manual searches. Even if manual searches could
be undertaken, it is likely that some data would be missed. For this study, a proprietary text mining
tool was used to scan the largest possible corpus of data in English. Algorithms using natural
language processing, among other techniques, were able to extract and record the number of
incidences where a technology (or other relevant entities such as occupations and country names)
was mentioned and keep track of all the inter-relationships between key terms.
Key sources used for the text mining analysis were patents and scientific papers in English. They
comprise a large and accessible corpus of structured data which is extremely important for the
reliability and completeness of results. Patents are widely considered a good proxy for measuring
innovation and anticipating technological changes, while papers and conference proceedings allow
the researchers to additionally capture information on social and economic factors. For patents, data
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 16

--- Page 20 ---

was taken from Espacenet, the official database of the European Patent Office, regarded by many as
the most authoritative source of patent information, containing over 120 million documents from
around the world and updated daily. For scientific papers, both Scopus (by Elsevier) and Web of
Science (by Clarivate) were used, the two largest databases of peer-reviewed papers, where an
equivalent study was performed on around 70 million scientific papers. In addition, white papers,
policy papers, project reports and foresight papers from Moroccan and international institutions were
searched using standard queries and downloaded to be analysed. But there were fewer of the latter
documents and they were also unstructured, so were not as relevant as patents and papers.
The data was processed with proprietary algorithms to harmonise names of inventors, authors,
companies and universities, and to consolidate the geo-localisation of parties according to the
nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) codes. The latter is clearly relevant for country-
specific studies. To maintain the focus on Morocco, two types of patents were selected: those issued
directly by the Moroccan Office of Industrial and Commercial Property, and international ones for
which at least one of the assignees was located in the country. Papers were selected if Morocco was
cited among the countries of interest for the study. Semantic algorithms were able to recognise
functional concepts rather than simple keywords, so they were used to scan the full text of each
document to identify those with a main focus on agri-food. Documents from as far back as 1948 were
retrieved, but for many analyses, data from only the last 10 or 15 years was used. This is a good time
window given the rather long cycles of agriculture, and restricting to even more recent periods would
have obscured most temporal trends.
The first phase of this text mining identified two main categories of relevant information: (i) technical
and societal drivers of change; and (ii) technologies introduced into the sector and their diffusion over
time. In the second phase of text mining, the information identified was compared and matched to the
associated occupations and skills listed in ESCO and O*NET by using semantic matching algorithms
(i.e. algorithms able to find semantic connections between different concepts based on contextual
information). For example, each occupation in the ESCO database included a description and a list
of competences, skills and knowledge considered relevant (either essential or optional) for that
occupation. The semantic algorithm looked for matches of each technology with all the concepts
associated with that occupation. When a match was found, the occupation was considered
associated with the technology. The entire procedure was automated using ESCO’s Application
Programming Interface (API), which allowed occupational data to be downloaded. If an occupation
was impacted upon by a technology at any level, then the text mining found it. If no match was found
in ESCO or O*NET due to emerging (future) jobs or new skills needs, other approaches – e.g.
connecting the new competences through Wikipedia – were used to try to identify them.
The main advantage of text mining is the ability to search a very large number of documents quickly.
In particular, patents and scientific papers are easy to access and structured (compared to social
media), so information extraction is facilitated. Although information may be scattered over many
different documents, algorithms are able to discover hidden patterns and emerging phenomena
which might not be detected by manual search techniques. By correlating concepts and extracting
trends, it allows weak signals to be detected and emerging trends to be spotted (see Figure 2.2).
This gives a future-oriented perspective and hints at what is not already known from the past.
Anticipating the future from the extrapolation of past trends, even with the most sophisticated
forecasting models, is likely to fail if the phenomenon of interest is subject to rapid and disruptive
change. Text mining at least provides a basis for identifying the variety of disruptive factors which
can then be explored with key stakeholders. This is particularly important when thinking about the
skills implications of technological change because there is an element of entering the unknown.

FIGURE 2.2 TEXT MINING EXTRACTS: CORRELATIONS AND TRENDS FROM THE DATA THAT
CAN BE TURNED INTO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF SKILLS AND JOB PROFILES
The third step was complementary qualitative research to obtain information from key stakeholders
and companies about their experience of technological change and other change drivers in the
sector and the new skills needs. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, focus group discussions were
convened online in June 2020 involving relevant stakeholders from the agri-food sector and the
education and training system. Around 60 representatives from government institutions, academia
and research, as well as public and private associations and organisations, attended the focus group
discussions. The purpose was to reflect on the results from the previous steps. After the focus group,
face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted between June 2020 and November 2020. A semi-
structured interview technique was used to guide the discussions. A final validation event with main
stakeholders was organised in November 2020.
2.3 Qualitative data collection
The first set of interviews was undertaken with key stakeholders in the agri-food sector. More than
20 stakeholders were identified during the planning of the fieldwork; the stakeholders represent a
broad base, including sector representatives (e.g. social partners and professional associations),
policy-makers, government organisations, education and training providers, universities, members of
the research community, intermediaries and entrepreneurs. Ten face-to-face stakeholder interviews
were conducted to gain insight into how they perceive and manage the process of technological
change and how they acquire the skills they need, but also what incentives there are for skills
development. A full list of these key stakeholders (as institutions, not individuals) is provided in
Annex. The names of individuals from these institutions are not included for data privacy reasons.
The second target group was the selected innovative companies in the sector, to understand their
perception and actions in managing the technological change process in the companies and ways of
finding the skills they need. The text mining from patents enabled identification of the top five
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 18

--- Page 22 ---

innovative companies (as measured by the most patent filing in recent years) for each technological
cluster or subsector during the analysis. This led to around 40 Moroccan companies being selected.
The list was manually revised to check for duplicates or for mergers and acquisitions and to ensure
variety across subsectors. Finally, the national expert integrated the list with other candidates, and
the resulting companies were contacted.
In total, 13 companies were interviewed from the sector, covering the widest possible spectrum of
agri-food activities and including enterprises of different sizes and types. The questions focused on
how companies deal with the process of technological change (including barriers to its
implementation such as shortages of capital and skills), and the impact on the content of jobs and the
related skills needs emerging from these changes. The names of the interviewed companies as well
as the individual names are kept confidential for data privacy reasons.
Collecting the views of key stakeholders and interviewing the most innovative companies was an
important step since new skills demands can be revealed only by understanding the responses of
companies to the signals about emerging technologies. Arguably, by interviewing the most innovative
companies, one may not provide a fully balanced picture, but the study wanted to collect evidence on
how technological changes, if implemented, affect employment and skills. The research therefore
needed to interview companies in the vanguard of technological change, so to speak, so that the
impact on skills demand could be identified.
2.4 Use of mixed methods in practice
In general, there was no contradiction between the results from the text mining and interviews.
Combining different research methods brought some advantages, as no single methodology can
identify all the emerging skills needs in the agri-food sector. Different techniques complemented one
another, each compensating for the potential shortcomings of the other. The results from different
research tools were then compared and verified. For example, companies’ product market and skills
strategies were difficult to collate by text mining, but this could be done by reading their annual
reports and interviewing key personnel. But these were not always ideal sources to find out about the
technologies which are transforming or are about to transform products and processes in their sector
as companies might simply be unaware of them. Here, text mining identified technologies that are
likely to have a major influence on companies’ strategies in the future, in addition to other
advantages of text mining discussed above.
Nevertheless, there are certain limitations of this study which need to be acknowledged.
■ The information provided by companies and other key stakeholders should be regarded as
indicative rather than comprehensive given that only a small number of people were interviewed
in the study. Future studies could include more interviews, with a more representative selection
of companies and stakeholders, but this tends to be resource-intensive and costly.
■ The text mining was limited to searches in English. French, for example, was not used in the
searches. It is likely to be the case, however, that most of the patents and scientific papers were
published in English in this period. For future analyses, there is scope to extend the text mining
tool to other languages to balance this limitation.
■ Despite the mixed methods approach used in the study, this report is not able to give an
indication of the scale or volume of any change in jobs and employment (e.g. it is not able to
estimate how many extra agronomists will be required), the relative importance of particular
skills, or the extent of any skills mismatches. Other methodologies are required to address these
issues.
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 19

--- Page 23 ---

■ Patents are proxies for innovation and tend to be concerned with emerging technologies (e.g.
patents are often filed to protect an innovation that is just about to come on stream). But it is
possible that some innovations are not patented. Moreover, patents are mainly linked to
technological innovation. Non-technological innovations are also important; the review of
scientific papers and interviews with companies and stakeholders captured other drivers of
change.
■ The analysis of skills was limited to those associated with technologies and other trends
identified by the text mining. If a certain technology was linked to occupations and skills at high
or medium level in ESCO and O*NET databases, this was captured. There were several cases
where this link did not exist (e.g. incomplete descriptions of skills). For example, agronomists are
not yet linked to precision agriculture in the ESCO database, but the company interviews
showed that agronomists that are sought after have to possess this new knowledge. It could be
expected that links might be missing more frequently in the case of medium- and low-skilled
occupations.
■ If there are completely new (future) occupations and skills needs, they have not been found in
the existing ESCO or O*NET databases. In these cases, other non-conventional data sources
such as Wikipedia were used to access and identify information beyond the traditional structured
ones, when considered non-exhaustive. However, it is clear that the information provided by
these types of sources should be handled with care.
Despite these limitations, the data science approach brings some added value. It builds on the
conventional forms of skills analyses such as undertaking skills surveys and carrying out skills
forecasting. It allows identification of the skill content of jobs in the agri-tech sector and possible
changes of skills with new technology. Thus, the focus is on actual jobs and how these will change
over the short to medium term, rather than broad aggregations of jobs into occupations. Data is
captured on specific skills in specific jobs rather than total demand for certain occupations. The
approach is flexible, and the algorithms can be run and rerun in a relatively speedy manner. This
means that if a sudden economic shock or a crisis of some kind emerges – such as Covid-19 – the
analysis can be quickly rerun to capture the effects of these (so long as there is data that can be
searched).
2.5 The impact of Covid-19 on the results of the study
The report was completed during the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, which brought a high
degree of uncertainty regarding the future of employment and skills demand. As the study is
concerned with the long-term development of skills demand resulting from technological change, the
findings are less sensitive to changes over the shorter term. The pace of change may slow down or
accelerate as a result of the pandemic, but the nature of that change is likely to remain the same.
The uptake of agri-food technologies (e.g. robots, drones and sensors for precision agriculture) may
be accelerated in the medium term in some countries due to the Covid-19 experience of high
dependency on importing essential goods from overseas (e.g. food and pharmaceuticals). Thus, the
contribution of technologies could be perceived as more important (or even essential) in the plans of
some countries for self-sustainable food production (i.e. not dependent on global production chains).

3. OVERVIEW OF THE AGRI-FOOD SECTOR
KEY ISSUES
■ This chapter looks at recent trends in the Moroccan economy and changes in the
overall demand for and supply of labour and skills.
■ Employment in the Moroccan agri-food sector is also reviewed, along with drivers
of skills demand in the agri-food sector.
The purpose of this chapter is scene setting. It provides an overview of recent developments in the
economy of Morocco and how this has affected the overall demand for employment and skills,
followed by the employment and skills developments in the Moroccan agri-food sector – both its
agricultural production arm and that relating to processing, packaging, marketing and distribution.
The chapter demonstrates that the agri-food sector is an important one in Morocco given the levels of
output and employment it accounts for. Additionally, the chapter points to several elements affecting
the performance of the economy and labour market over recent years. Key among these is the
education and skills system which has struggled to provide the country – and its population – with
skills that have value in the labour market. This is not to say that the education and skills system is
the principal factor constraining the development of the economy or agri-food sector. Rather, this is
an issue of particular importance to the study on which this report is based. As the economy adapts
to technological trends and attempts to shift into higher value segments of the global economy, there
is a danger that skills shortages will inhibit any such shift. This may be particularly acute in the agri-
food sector given the relatively low skills levels of many of those working in the sector today.
3.1 The economy
Economic growth in Morocco has been relatively strong in recent years and was largely unaffected
by the 2008 economic crisis. As shown in Figure 3.1, GDP growth from 2008 to 2018 was
consistently positive unlike that of other countries in the Maghreb which were hit harder by the
political turmoil of the Arab Spring and its economic consequences. In the recent past, Morocco has
averaged GDP growth of around 3% a year. Before the advent of Covid-19, both the World Bank and
the African Development Bank had forecast relatively strong growth for 2020 and 2021: the former
forecast real growth of 3.5% in 2020 and 3.6% in 2022; and the latter forecast growth of 3.7% in
2020 and 3.9% in 20213.
The Covid-19 crisis drastically changed the growth forecasts. In March 2020, the Centre marocain de
conjoncture forecast that GDP growth would slow to 0.8% in 2020, compared with its January
forecast of 3.5%. This reflected the economic impact of Covid-19 containment measures as well as
the drought which adversely affected the agricultural sector4. In June 2020, the International

economy to grow relatively strongly over the short term.

Growth over recent years was driven by a number of factors, including diversification of the economy
away from agriculture and into food processing, car manufacturing, aviation and electronics. The
country’s location and political stability means that it is an ideal hub for companies looking to operate
in Africa. Additionally, the amended law on public–private partnerships and the government’s
regionalisation policy has increased the attractiveness of the country to national and international
investors (World Bank, n.d.). But there are several structural weaknesses that are likely to constrain
the economy’s capacity to grow over the short to medium term, such as:
■ relatively low levels of human capital development and mismatches between the outputs of the
education and training system and those required in the private sector;
■ rigidities in the labour market which impede job creation and are seen as a determinant of
relatively high levels of youth unemployment (bearing in mind the population is a relatively young
one);
■ a relatively large informal sector;
■ with specific reference to the agri-food sector, relatively low productivity growth over time.
Morocco is ranked 53rd out of 190 economies by the World Bank in its Doing Business 2020 report,
up seven places compared with the year before (World Bank, 2019a; 2020). The country has
implemented comprehensive regulatory reforms over the past couple of years, making it easier to do
business. In particular, Morocco has improved dealing with construction permits, obtaining electricity
supply, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, and enforcing contracts
(World Bank, 2020). Morocco is also a relatively open economy. In 2018, it exported USD 33.7 billion
of goods and services, and imported USD 48.3 billion, giving it a net trade imbalance of
USD 14.6 billion. Over recent years, the value of imports has increased more slowly than that of
exports: between 2013 and 2018, the value of exports increased by USD 7.2 billion, while imports
increased by only USD 3.6 billion. The principal exports are cars and fertilisers, and the principal

import is refined petroleum. Morocco’s main trading partner is the EU, particularly Spain, France,
Germany and Italy6.
3.2 The labour market
Demographic change reduced the dependency ratio by half between 2004 and 2014, but the
economy has struggled to capitalise on this, with employment growth faltering and relatively high
levels of youth unemployment7. The employment to population ratio (15+) weakened from 2009 to
2019 (see Figure 3.2) while the unemployment rate was more or less constant at around 10%8.
According to the World Bank (n.d. b), only 129 000 jobs are created annually, while the working-age
population increases by 300 000 each year. Faltering employment growth has been explained by
reference to weak economic growth in Europe on which Morocco is dependent for much of its trade
(African Development Bank Group, n.d.). According to the Haut Commissariat au Plan, one in four
people aged 15 to 24 in 2019 were unemployed, as were 15% of people aged 25 to 34. Moreover,
the statistics point to unemployment tending to be long term, particularly in urban areas: in 2019,
71.1% of unemployed people in urban areas had been out of work for more than 12 months (68.2%
at the national level)9. Youth unemployment is seen as a threat to social stability for most countries in
north Africa, including Morocco.

By way of summary, Table 3.1 compares key labour market statistics for Morocco with the average in
the EU-28. It is immediately apparent that activity rates and employment rates are lower in Morocco,
especially for women, while unemployment rates are higher. The table indicates that the situation vis-
à-vis activity and employment rates in Morocco has been deteriorating over recent years whereas it
has been improving in the EU-28. The ETF Torino Process report for Morocco (2017b) points to a

number of other structural weaknesses in the labour market which succinctly encapsulate the current
situation.
1. Lack of inclusion: young people and women are not well integrated into the labour market. While
many young people are staying in education for longer, the relatively high levels of youth
unemployment point to people leaving education and training struggling to find jobs. The rate of
labour force participation by women is low: 22% in 2018 compared to 71% 2018 for men10.
2. Job creation has been insufficient to absorb the rising number of young people entering the
labour market. In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises have struggled to support
employment growth.
3. A large share of employment is in the informal sector which indicates that job quality and
productivity are low. It is apparent that much of the growth in non-agricultural employment has
been in low-skilled work (World Bank, n.d. b).
4. Graduate unemployment. Possessing a degree in Morocco does not seem to confer increased
protection from becoming unemployed.
The report (ETF, 2017b) also highlights relatively low levels of educational attainment on exit from
the education system which stymies the further development of human capital. As can be seen from
Table 3.1, Morocco compares unfavourably with the European Union (EU) on some key measures
related to human capital development. This is turned to next.
Occupation and level of educational attainment are proxy measures of skill. Figure 3.3 shows levels
of educational attainment in Morocco. It shows that a large share of the active population did not
complete compulsory education, accounting for around 6.48 million people in 2018. The share of
people without a qualification was even higher among self-employed people, who accounted for
more than 40% of employment in the agricultural sector in 201811.
When looking at skills demand, the occupational data for Morocco – see Figure 3.4 – shows that
overall a relatively small share of the population is employed in relatively high-skilled jobs (certainly
when compared to the average situation in the EU). It also reveals that a relatively high share of all
employment (more than a third) is in jobs directly related to agriculture, with many of these being in
relatively low-skilled jobs. This becomes particularly evident when looking at educational attainment
of the workforce. According to the Haut Commissariat au Plan, among the economically active
population who did not complete compulsory education (6.2 million people in 2018), almost half of
them (3.1 million people in 2018) worked in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, constituting the vast
majority (82.2%) of the total employment in this sector in 201812.

3.3 Skills
A problem frequently mentioned by commentators is the relatively low level of educational attainment
among the population and workforce. According to the World Bank (Chauffour, 2018), in 2018 there
were approximately 600 000 Moroccans aged 20, of whom 400 000 had not passed the
baccalaureate exam and were therefore low skilled, with limited prospects of finding relatively good-
quality employment. Projections indicate that of the 200 000 young people with a high school
diploma, only 50 000 will receive adequate training to secure a job in line with their expectations,
while roughly 140 000 will acquire skills that have little value in the labour market. An estimated
10 000 young people (less than 2% of people aged 20 in 2018) will obtain degrees likely to lead to
high waged employment (ibid.). These estimates – projecting the future educational outcomes of the
system in place in 2018 – tend to underline how the education system is often far removed from the
needs of the labour market. If left unchecked, this will potentially impose a severe constraint on the
future development of the economy and labour market.
Morocco has sought to invest in education and skills. The evidence shows that Morocco invests a
relatively high share of its GDP in education: in 2016, expenditure on education was 4.7% of GDP,
slightly below the average of 5.1% found in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) countries (ETF/Badescu, 2019)13. This accounted for 23.6% of total
government expenditure, which is almost double the average share in the EU (12% in 2016)14. The
majority of government expenditure on education is directed towards secondary education (42% in
2009) and primary education (38%), while tertiary education accounts for 20%. These levels of
investment reflect the government’s stated aims to improve the education of the population and
improve their living conditions. Improvements in the quality of education and its inclusiveness are
regarded as central to tackling Morocco’s main social challenges, such as high youth unemployment,
illiteracy, and the differences between urban and rural populations (OECD, 2018).
In 2018, 94% of Moroccan children were enrolled in their final year of primary school, compared with
82% in 2008, signalling a reduction in school dropouts15. Figure 3.5 reveals how enrolment rates at
all levels increased from 2006 to 201816. Though still far short of those in the EU at secondary and
tertiary levels, they increased substantially, especially so at the tertiary level. The International
Monetary Fund commented that dropout rates are still high, with 72% of all students leaving the
education system without any qualifications in 2016. Furthermore, the skills students acquire in the
school system appear to be insufficiently matched to the needs of the labour market and to the need
to boost employment in higher value added activities (Blancher et al., 2016).

16 Enrolment rates are calculated by dividing the number of students of a particular age group enrolled in a given
level of education by the number of people in the population in that age group.

The share of secondary education accounted for by vocational education has been increasing but
remained relatively low at 14% in 2017 when compared with the EU (ETF, 2019). Over half of all
graduates are concentrated in management and commerce, metallurgy/mechanics, and construction,
and a third of VET students become ‘specialised technicians’ (Ministry of Employment and Social
Affairs, 2016; ETF, 2019). The budget allocated to the vocational training sector is estimated to have
been around 0.2% of GDP in 2016 and has been stable over recent years. The funding of VET is
particularly complex due to the multitude of stakeholders and funding sources involved. Funding
comes from a variety of sources, mainly from the state (38%) but also from the VET tax (23%),
households (23%) and companies (14%) (UNESCO-UNEVOC, 2019).
According to the National Strategy for Vocational Training 2021, Morocco is facing a number of
challenges when it comes to its VET system. Some of them are common to the whole education
system, such as the high level of student dropout rates and insufficient inclusion of certain parts of
the population (e.g. people from rural areas and/or from disadvantaged families). But other
challenges are specific to the VET system, such as the low level of participation (the technical VET
country profile from UNESCO-UNEVOC highlights a 3.3% participation rate in technical VET for
people aged 15 to 24 recorded in 2019), its lack of attractiveness to students who perform well in
school, and criticisms from employers about its capacity to meet their skills needs (UNESCO-
UNEVOC, 2019). There is an observed mismatch between the skills obtained in the VET system and
those which employers need, despite the introduction of skills forecasting/anticipation tools that are
designed to bring about better matching (ibid.). Skills mismatches are widely recognised as
impediments to both improving the employment prospects of young people and shifting the economy
into higher value added segments of the global economy (Blancher et al., 2016).

3.4 The agri-food sector
If one looks at the distribution of employment by sector in Morocco, it is apparent that a relatively large
share – compared with the EU – is located in agriculture (see Figure 3.6). More than one-third of the
workforce is found in the sector. Much of this employment is concentrated in relatively low-skill, low-
value work which has proven difficult to change. But it is not only agriculture which reveals productivity
levels stagnating; the same situation applies to industry which, like agriculture, has not been able to
boost its share of GDP (African Development Bank, n.d.).

The agri-food sector is an important part of the Moroccan economy. As noted in Chapter 2, the agri-
food sector is described with reference to the agricultural sector and its intersection with the food
processing industry. It therefore includes the commercial production of food by farming and
technologies related to agriculture, horticulture, and food and drink processing. Besides farming and
agriculture, the sector is linked to the processing, conversion, preparation, preservation, distribution,
and packaging of foodstuffs. Bearing this definition in mind, a description of output, employment and
skills in the agri-food sector is now provided17.
Development of the agri-food sector
As previously mentioned, agriculture accounts for almost 40% of the total employment and 12% of
the total value added in the country. The Moroccan economy is heavily influenced by agricultural
production, which is in turn influenced by the availability of water for irrigation: in years of drought,
GDP growth consistently shrinks. For instance, in 2016 (a dry year) GDP growth stood at 1.2%,
compared with 4.5% in 2015 and 4.1% in 2017 (not dry years).
17 For this research it was not possible to retrieve specific data on employment in the agri-food sector. By
combining data from both the agricultural sector and the food processing sector, the research team estimates
the agri-food sector employs around 4.5 million people in the country, which represents a little over 40% of
employed people in the country.
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 29

--- Page 33 ---

Similarly, food processing is also an important economic activity in Morocco. In 2018 the food
processing industry was Morocco’s second-largest industrial subsector, accounting for 25% of the
total industrial GDP with revenues over MAD 100 billion (EUR 9 billion) (EU Delegation to Morocco,
2020). In 2016, the food processing industry employed 141 000 people, organised in 2 050
establishments, representing 23% of the industrial workforce18.
The agri-food sector plays a key role in the rural development and food security of the country, but in
doing so it needs to overcome a number of challenges. These include (African Development Bank,
2019):
■ soil erosion and soil degradation;
■ drought, often coupled with inefficient water management systems;
■ disparities between large and small farms due to parcelling of property;
■ lack of sufficient sectoral investments (both from the public and private sectors);
■ lack of proper diversification of crops;
■ large dependence on exports towards third countries (Europe and North America especially).
In terms of international trade, agriculture accounted for approximately 20% of total imports and
about 21% of the country’s total exports in 2019 (ibid.). In 2018, vegetable products accounted for
9.3% (USD 3.12 billion) of all exports, followed by foodstuffs (any substance used as food or to make
food) at 6.7% (USD 2.24 billion). Among foodstuffs, the most prominent products exported are
processed fish and processed crustaceans, which together account for 64% of all exported foodstuffs
with a total export value of USD 1.4 billion in 2018. Processed vegetables, fruits and nuts accounted
for around USD 220 million, around 10% of the export value for all foodstuffs. The food processing
industry has particular ties to specific Moroccan regions, with the Agadir area being particularly
renowned for the presence of fish processing plants, and the Marrakech, Casablanca, Fès and
Meknès areas being particularly active in the domain of processing vegetables and fruits.
Over the years the Moroccan government has put in place a range of policies to sustain the
development of agriculture and food processing sectors. For instance, the country has made water
resource management more transparent for users by requiring information on water resources to be
made publicly available so that resources are used more efficiently (World Bank, 2019b). Moreover,
as a result of efforts by authorities to diversify exports and decrease the dependence on Europe –
which is the origin of and destination for three-quarters of Morocco’s total trade – the agri-food sector
has grown 8.2% since 2013 (African Development Bank, n.d.).
In the various policies implemented over recent years, the most important strategy by far for the agri-
food sector is the Green Morocco Plan for 2008 to 2020. The plan, launched in 2008, was designed
to promote the development of 1.15 million jobs by 2020 and triple the income of nearly 3 million
people in rural areas19. The strategy was designed to support the development of agri-food by
fostering closer links between producers and the processing industry (integration of upstream and
downstream processes) and fostering integration/cooperation as an organisational model (i.e.
bringing together producers and farmers). According to the Ministry of Agriculture, integration/
cooperation is the most appropriate solution to overcome the issue of small farms (70% of Moroccan
farmers own less than five hectares), and to tackle the challenges related to the lack of technical and
managerial skills and of appropriate financial means for these farmers to modernise their production

systems. In this way, bringing together the production and the commercialisation of agricultural
products, farmers obtain the skills needed to optimise their production from partners in projects,
resulting in the optimisation of the production process at all levels20.
The Green Morocco Plan has produced positive results, though not as positive as originally planned.
As an example, of the 1.15 million jobs to be created by 2020, only 342 000 additional job
opportunities (less than a third) were created as of 2018. On the other hand, the plan stimulated
investments in the agricultural sector (a total of MAD 104 billion between 2008 and 2018). On
fostering cooperation among farmers (especially smallholders), the incentives system fostered by the
state supported 63 aggregation projects (in 2018) benefitting around 55 000 farmers, 80% of whom
own less than five hectares or arable land21. Moreover, the plan has allowed the country to increase
self-sufficiency to around 98% to 100% for meat, milk, fruits and vegetables, while it is 65% for
cereals and 47% for sugar. As for the long-standing issue of water management, the plan has
allowed the country to save 2 billion cubic metres of water by investing in more efficient irrigation
techniques. As a result, the surface area of crop fields with drip irrigation has almost quadrupled
since the plan was introduced22.
The Ministry of Agriculture has also identified some challenges and shortcomings of the plan, such
as the failed modernisation of slaughterhouses and not yet having a better structure for the food
distribution industry, which is believed to be of crucial importance to sustain and increase the
efficiency of the Moroccan agri-food sector and enhance domestic demand. One of the main critiques
of the Green Morocco Plan by commentators was the lack of coordination with other sectoral
development strategies implemented over the same period of time, for instance the ‘Emergence’ plan
for industry. Other critiques mention the ‘standard’ approach to agricultural development, relying on
increased investments and failing to thoroughly take into account the specific features of Moroccan
agriculture, especially in rural areas, where the activity is mostly run by small family businesses that
lack the capacity and resources to engage in bigger projects and attract larger investments (Akesbi,
2011).
The agri-food sector faces productivity challenges. The aggregation model fostered by the Green
Morocco Plan, based on cooperatives, plays a central role in sectoral improvement, being an
innovative way to connect small- and large-scale producers, generating yields and ensuring
agricultural production is in line with the requirements of the food industry (ibid.). It is not clear to
what extent this has resulted in productivity improvements.
Other initiatives have focused particularly on agri-food, such as the National Pact for Industrial
Emergence (Pacte national pour l’émergence industrielle – PNEI (2009–2015)) to support sector
growth by creating agropoles; the Industrial Acceleration Plan (2014–2020); and the Contract
Programme 2017–2022 for agri-food. The PNEI23 focused on the important potential for economic
growth for Moroccan agri-food, and aimed at exploiting this potential through a range of supporting
measures such as a better development of agricultural resources and a diversified and competitive
offer especially dedicated to exports. In order to do this, the PNEI focused on 8 to 10 value chains
with particularly high potential for exports, such as argan, olive oil, spices and processed vegetables

and fruits. Among other measures, these value chains have been supported through the construction
of dedicated agropoles in six regions of Morocco.
Another initiative impacting agribusiness is the Industrial Acceleration Plan (2014–2020)24. The plan
was a successful strategy launched to boost the Moroccan industrial sector and fully exploit its
potential for economic and employment growth. The plan was very successful: the target of creating
500 000 new jobs was reached or even exceeded in all targeted sectors in 2019, and overall
industrial exports increased between 2014 and 2019 by more than 39%. The agri-food sector made a
strong contribution to the plan’s results: the sector contributed to the creation of more than 83 000
jobs between 2014 and 2019 and the sector’s exports increased by more than 38%, which
demonstrates the great dynamic and growth potential of this industry.
Finally, the Contract Programme 2017–2022 for agri-food is also a relevant policy for agribusiness25.
It focuses on seven value chains considered the most important for sectoral development, due to
their prominence and potential: citrus, fruits and vegetables; olive oil; dairy; meat; pastries and
chocolate production; pasta; and couscous. The programme has specific targets to be reached by its
conclusion and engages relevant stakeholders to achieve these targets. Relevant actors are not only
the responsible ministries, but also professional associations, to make sure the effort is truly
collective.
Recent policy developments
Cooperatives are defined by Moroccan law as autonomous and voluntary associations to meet their
common economic, social and cultural needs through a jointly owned and democratically controlled
enterprise. The Green Morocco Plan favoured the creation of cooperatives around shared projects to
improve agriculture in specific regions, but also designated the state as facilitator in supporting
existing cooperatives, for instance by providing financial incentives and preferential access to credit
to finance relevant projects and by fostering private investments in the agri-food sector26. As shown
in Figure 3.7, cooperatives are more numerous in the subsectors of dairy, red meat, and honey
production. Cooperatives are also numerous in the agricultural services subsector.
It has been observed that the general lack of managerial and financial management capacity in agri-
food cooperatives makes it difficult to ensure the sustainability and growth of operations and creates
obstacles in terms of access to finance. This, in turn, generates additional problems, such as
difficulties in adopting competitive industrial processes or adequate quality control systems (Pereira
and Santos, 2018). Therefore, despite being the model of choice for Moroccan authorities to pursue
sectoral development, research shows that the cooperative system is unlikely to perform its duties
properly without an appropriate education and vocational training system that is able to address the
skills needs of the agricultural workforce.

In spring 2020, a new strategy for agriculture was launched, Génération Green (2020–2030)27. This
new strategy builds on the achievements of the Green Morocco Plan and further consolidates the
growth for the sector and the subsequent social effects.
The new strategy focuses particularly on human capital development, aiming at enhancing revenue
of farmers through investments and wider access to social protection for workers in the agricultural
sector. The strategy also aims to promote the sector among young people, to make working in
agriculture as employees but especially as entrepreneurs more attractive to them. The strategy will
make arable land available by offering funding to 180 000 young entrepreneurs to launch start-ups28.
The strategy aims to have 350 000 new workers and entrepreneurs not only in the agricultural sector
but also in all services related to it (i.e. other agri-food subsectors such as food processing, but also
services such as the provision of irrigation systems or pesticides/fertilisers). Finally, the strategy aims
to support the creation of new agricultural organisations and cooperatives, with the aim of having five
times more of such organisations by 2030, while also providing support to the implementation of
digitalisation and new technologies in all agricultural activities29.
Employment
As previously mentioned, agri-food is a very important sector in Morocco. Output (value added) from
the agricultural sector accounts for around 12% of total output, while the food processing industry
alone accounts for 25% of the total industrial GDP for Morocco (EU Delegation to Morocco, 2020).
The value added from agriculture has remained relatively stable over time. But as Figure 3.8 reveals,
agriculture is a major source of employment at around 40% of total employment (compared with the

EU-28, where agriculture accounts for only around 4% of total employment), indicating that it is a
relatively low productivity sector. Even though employment in the sector has been falling, from 45%
of all employment in 2006 to 38% in 2019, it remains much higher than the share of value added it
produces. It needs to be noted that this underestimates the overall level of employment in the agri-
food sector since it excludes those who are employed in the food processing sector (part of the
manufacturing sector).

As noted above, the agri-food sector is important for employment, especially so in rural areas. It is
estimated that around 4 million rural inhabitants are employed in the agri-food industry. This estimate
reveals that, particularly in rural areas, agriculture is largely dependent on a large workforce and
relies very little on techniques and technologies aimed at increasing productivity30.
Additionally, one important factor to be taken into account is the extent of subsistence agriculture, i.e.
when people are registered as self-employed and work in their own family field, producing food for
their own use. This could particularly be the case for women, especially in rural areas. Recent data
shows that around half of employed people are self-employed (48.6% in 2019), compared to only
15.2% in the EU-27 in the same year31. In 2019, self-employed women constituted 57.1% of total
female employment, compared to 45.9% for self-employed men32. In 2018, 41.5% of self-employed
people worked in agriculture, forestry and fisheries; 25.9% of the total self-employed population
worked in urban areas, while 35.7% worked in rural areas33. The high share of employment and self-
employment in the agricultural sector, coupled with the prevalence of smallholders, points towards an

Innovation and skills
As presented in previous sections, the agri-food sector has been the target of a series of important
public and private investments over the years. Investments have mainly targeted innovation in water
management and irrigation techniques as well as the differentiation of crops and the enhancement of
self-sufficiency for agricultural production. Some attention has also been given to innovation on a
systemic level, in the way producers are interconnected among themselves and with the food
processing industries. More recently, with the Green Morocco Plan and especially Génération Green,
increasing importance has been given to human capital development and skills.
In line with the integration/cooperation approach that has driven investments and innovation in the
sector, Moroccan authorities have been developing agricultural production sites (agropoles) in some
key regions to strengthen upstream and downstream collaboration among relevant stakeholders and
attract agri-food investments (as well as foreign investments). The regions of Fès-Meknès and
Berkane, in northern Morocco, already have agropoles, supported by the public Caisse de dépôt et de
gestion that finances territorial development activities in the whole country. Four additional sites are
planned for the central regions of Tadla and El Haouz and for the coastal regions of Agadir and Gharb.
Each agropole is designed to offer the following elements (Agency for Agricultural Development, 2015):
■ an area of agro-industrial activities where food production companies are located;
■ an area of logistics and service companies including business incubators;
■ an area dedicated to distribution and trade activities;
■ an element of research and development (R&D) (represented by the Institut national de la
recherche agronomique (INRA)), and food quality control authorities (represented by the Office
national de sécurité sanitaire des produits alimentaires (ONSSA) and Morocco FOODEX);
■ a dedicated training centre;
■ an area dedicated to specific tertiary activities, such as banks, insurance companies, catering
and other relevant services.
Agropoles represent important elements of innovation in the way the different stakeholders in the
agri-food sector can interact and foster integration between upstream and downstream processes.
They also constitute an important innovative model of cooperation among these stakeholders, as well
as an innovative way to attract investments (both from national and foreign investors). The
implementation of agropoles is still in its infancy, with only two out of six planned sites being
operational at the time of writing. If fully exploited, the potential for aggregation and integration of
stakeholders in the agri-food value chain will boost the economic potential for the sector, which
suffers from the presence of many smallholders and small industries.
Acknowledging the need for specific and good-quality education for this sector, the Green Morocco
Plan defines a range of measures to support higher agricultural education and VET. For instance, the
four public institutions providing higher agricultural education34 were due to merge into a polytechnic,
with the aim of pooling resources and coordinating actions and curricula among themselves and with
other relevant stakeholders (i.e. VET providers), as well as operate with more transparency and
rationality (Agency for Agricultural Development, 2015).

Agadir, the ENA of Meknès and the National School of Forestry engineers in Salé.

One constraint in the development of agri-food is the lack of enough training centres for agri-food
technicians, as currently only one centre exists in Casablanca. It is worth noting that IAV Hassan II
no longer provides training at the level of technicians, but public and private universities are providing
technician-level and bachelor’s degrees. For VET, the Green Morocco Plan distinguishes between
three different providers with specific roles (ibid.):
■ agricultural vocational training, aimed at improving the technical and competitive aspects of
businesses and farms by meeting their employees’ skills needs, through training for adults
offering qualifications for qualified and specialised technicians and workers;
■ technical agricultural education, a dedicated path in lower secondary education (classes in
agricultural technology) and upper secondary education (baccalaureate in agricultural sciences)
aiming to equip young students with the technical knowledge to pursue studies in agriculture,
making the agricultural sector more attractive;
■ apprenticeship training for the social and professional integration of rural youths, especially
targeted at young people living in rural areas who have dropped out of education with only
primary education or no qualifications.
The Moroccan government has always recognised the importance of investing in skills in the
agricultural workforce to develop its potential for economic growth. On top of investments made in
recent years, more investments and policy developments in terms of employment and skills are part
of Génération Green, the new strategy to support the Moroccan agri-food sector. Nevertheless,
implementation of the strategy itself as well as the ‘normal’ development of the sector have been
heavily impacted by the Covid-19 crisis, and the medium-term growth outcomes are still quite
uncertain due to the current economic conditions and forecasts for the future, both at the national
and global level.
Commentators have noted that the efforts of the Moroccan government to increase agricultural self-
sufficiency in the past two decades have been proved to be working. During spring 2020, when
Covid-19 had its first impact in Morocco, the agricultural sector was able to provide the domestic
market with an abundant supply of food while exports of fruits and vegetables grew 3% by mid-April
compared with the same period of 201935. On the other hand, a severe drought has impacted
production, and this will likely lead to an increase in imports of some products such as wheat and
grains (North Africa Post, 2020).
The Covid-19 pandemic has underlined the importance of digitalisation in the agri-food sector. In a
statement from the Ministry of Industry, Trade and the Green and Digital Economy, digitalisation is
reported as a key lever for national operators in agri-food to upgrade and enter high-value markets,
increase productivity and secure new export markets by better aligning output with customers’
requirements36. Supporting digitalisation in the agri-food sector is part of the Génération Green
strategy and is complemented by the work of the Moroccan Digital Development Agency, which is a
partner of the industry supporting digital education37. R&D is seen as critically important to the
development of the agri-food sector. The roadmap for the agricultural sector mentions the potential
for increases in the export of olive oil, tomatoes, preserved fruits (particularly apricots), biscuits,
pastries and chocolate, and ready meals, sauces and snacks. In all these sectors, R&D is seen as

36 www.agrimaroc.ma/maroc-digitalisation-agroalimentaire/
37 Ibid.
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 36

--- Page 40 ---

crucial to unlocking the development potential of these goods. The roadmap draws attention to
competences in R&D being in need of development38.
The agri-food sector is supported by a number of organisations and institutions that contribute to the
economic development of the sector. Some of these institutions are specific for the agricultural/agri-
food sector, while others deal with labour market and training policies at the national level. These
institutions often have complementary duties and work in cooperation with one another to implement
major public initiatives and carry out research and sectoral studies. The main actors are listed below.
■ Agence nationale de promotion de l’emploi et des compétences (Anapec) is the Moroccan public
body charged with the management of active labour market policies.
■ Agence pour le développement agricole (ADA) is a public institution with legal personality and
financial authority. It is under the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Rural
Development, Water and Forests. It plays a key role in achieving the strategic goals set for the
agricultural sector. Launching concrete projects, intermediation, implementation monitoring, and
managing partnerships with institutional and social investors are the core tasks entrusted to
ADA.
■ Confédération générale des entreprises du Maroc is the association representing the private
sector vis-à-vis the relevant public bodies in Morocco.
■ Fédération nationale de l’agroalimentaire (Fenagri) is a confederation of 20 national federations
with more than 100 companies directly affiliated, including some of the big players in the sector.
It was created in 1996 and now is charged with the supervision of the Development Programme
for Agribusiness 2017–2021.
■ Groupement interprofessionnel d’aide au conseil du secteur agroalimentaire (GIAC AGRO) is a
non-profit association established by eight associations of the agri-food sector, and whose
general purpose is, among other things, to promote advice on training to its members. The GIAC
cooperates with Fenagri in a horizontal way to respond to companies’ training needs.
■ INRA was created in 1914 and is the major research organisation dedicated to agricultural
research and innovation.
■ IAV Hassan II and the National School of Agriculture de Meknès are the major higher education
organisations within the mandate of the Department of Agriculture.
■ Office de la formation professionnelle et de la promotion du travail (OFPPT) is a public body
charged with the management of vocational education.
■ Office national du conseil agricole (ONCA) is a public body responsible for leading, coordinating
and monitoring implementation of the agricultural development strategy at the national level.
■ ONSSA is a public body responsible for the safety of food products and the conformity of food
imported into Morocco.
■ Morocco FOODEX: Food Export Control and Coordination is a public structure under the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Rural Development, Water and Forests, created in 1986. Since
then, it has been dedicated to the service of the agri-food and maritime products sector, one of
the levers of the country’s economic growth.
The existence of specialised bodies dealing with skills, research and training needs of the agri-food
sector allows for a better targeting of policies and initiatives to the needs of the sector. Nonetheless,
some commentators have observed that the division of responsibilities for VET (and of sectoral
policies more in general) among many actors makes coordination and integration of initiatives
38 www.intracen.org/uploadedFiles/Feuille_de_route_secteur_agroalimentaire_final.pdf
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 37

--- Page 41 ---

difficult, therefore undermining the effectiveness of sectoral policies. Integration between companies,
following the models of agropoles, and also more cooperation and integration on the side of
specialised public bodies could be pursued to fully exploit the potential of dedicated sectoral bodies
to be in close contact with companies and respond quickly to sectoral needs.

4. KEY DRIVERS OF CHANGE IN THE AGRI-
FOOD SECTOR
KEY ISSUES
■ Analysis of the main drivers of change currently shaping the sector, such as global
value chains, new technologies, digital tools and international regulations.
The preceding chapter outlined the broad contours of skills demand in the agri-food sector. In moving
towards a more detailed analysis of skills needs – i.e. what are the actual skills people use in their
jobs and how are these skills likely to change? – there is a need to understand the factors driving the
change and those technologies that are associated with that change. It is not just about technological
change: a need to consider a variety of non-technological factors which will shape the future is
relevant as well. In the sections that follow, consideration is given to the range of technological and
non-technological factors driving change in the agri-food sector in Morocco.
4.1 Identifying drivers of demand
Fast technological development is one of the major factors influencing the demand for skills. There
are many other factors such as social, economic and environmental ones which also determine and
shape future skills needs. In order to study all the possible drivers of change, the entire Scopus and
Web of Science databases were searched to find scientific papers and conference proceedings
related to the agri-food sector in Morocco. In addition, websites were scoured for direct information
and links to various studies. The documents gathered were scanned using text mining tools to extract
the most relevant keywords which were then clustered using network analysis.
Figure 4.1 provides a snapshot of such a clustering process: for example, the red group of connected
terms clearly points to the semantic area of innovation along the supply chain. Browsing the network
of correlations between the topics provides an understanding of the relationships among them. For
instance, the introduction of innovative solutions could lead to a reuse of agricultural waste, for the
production, for example, of biomass energy, which then leads to a positive environmental impact and
the reduction of deforestation (red, yellow, blue and light-blue clusters respectively). Inspection of all
clusters provides the basis for identifying potential candidates for drivers of change.
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 39

FIGURE 4.1 NETWORK DIAGRAM OF KEYWORDS RELATED TO THE AGRI-FOOD SECTOR
IN MOROCCO FROM THE ANALYSIS OF SCIENTIFIC PAPERS
A driver of change is considered to be a factor that strongly influences the evolution of future
scenarios. By combining the clustering with an analysis of change over time (i.e. the number of
scientific papers each year), it is possible to identify if one is observing phenomena that are
increasing (see Figure 4.2 for examples). Compared to other drivers, globalisation has a higher
number of occurrences within the considered dataset of papers. For this reason, to better appreciate
the trends, two graphs are shown; the percentage value on the vertical axis shows the difference in
scale.
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 40

--- Page 44 ---

FIGURE 4.2 DISTRIBUTION OVER THE YEARS OF KEY CONCEPTS IDENTIFIED FROM
THE ANALYSIS OF SCIENTIFIC PAPERS ON AGRI-FOOD
From the above-described text mining analysis, a series of non-technological drivers of change were
identified. Each of those can bring some changes to the sector and, in turn, may cause new profiles
to be created for the sector.
The results obtained were validated and supplemented by the interviews with both stakeholders and
companies during the field missions. This led to the identification of some additional drivers of
change not captured by the text mining: productivity, quality of products and changes in Moroccan
habits.
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 41

--- Page 45 ---

Globalisation
The relevance of globalisation seen from the data mining analysis was confirmed in the interviews,
which indicated it as a main driver of change, often affecting several subsequent factors.
The increased competition that has arisen following globalisation has in some cases been a positive
factor for innovation and for finding other business solutions. In other cases, it has led to the
abandonment of some business lines due to their uncompetitive price point compared to foreign
operators (i.e. in the case of free trade agreements).
The different starting conditions of companies within the sector have led to a series of possible
scenarios. Many small-scale farmers seem to be focused on short-term issues while other
companies focus on globalisation as they find the international market more profitable than the local
market (e.g. companies that started as international exporters before being suppliers for the domestic
market). Generally, the export of products is widespread among medium and large companies, both
to North America and to Europe.
If this is true for commercialisation aspects, the same can be said for issues related to technology,
skills and competitiveness. Globalisation also implies a structured value and logistics chain and a
high-quality standard. Since technologies often come from foreign companies, globalisation has
positively affected the sector from the point of view of modernisation of storage, production
techniques, and environmental protection. Some of the conferences and fairs in which some
Moroccan companies take part are also international. Attending postgraduate degrees abroad and
doing internships with European universities allow Moroccan students and workers to bring new
skills, knowledge and innovation to the area.
The opening of borders has certainly favoured an exchange of international collaboration and
projects (such as the Millennium Challenge Corporation). An open benchmark with producers from
other countries has begun, usually unfavourably because of the higher Moroccan taxation and cost of
energy and smaller internal market. Very often imported goods are cheaper than locally produced
ones. Moreover, many new operators have entered the sector, in particular big farms. In such a
competitive environment, people have started to look for alternative and advantageous solutions. It is
precisely this international competitiveness that has encouraged local producers to improve their
offer by reducing costs and looking for a higher quality standard. It has also prompted the shift to
different crops (e.g. olive oil, which received support from the Green Morocco Plan) or the exploration
of niche markets (e.g. organic agriculture).
Government support and taxation
Agri-food is an important and strategic sector for the country. The government has implemented
important measures for the economic development of the sector. The Green Morocco Plan has
certainly boosted the agri-food sector on the production side while Génération Green will focus on
enhancing the value of production. Moreover, the creation of agropoles has built a bridge between
agriculture and agri-food. Government incentives and the presence of governmental and non-
governmental bodies, such as FOODEX, Maroc PME (petites et moyennes entreprises), chambers of
commerce and green industrial areas, are all important factors that support innovation.
The division of roles and tasks between the two ministries (the Ministry of Agriculture, which pursues
upstream activities, and the Ministry of Industry, which focuses on downstream processes) seems in
some cases to slow down the pace of improvements, since the division brings difficulties in the
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 42

--- Page 46 ---

governance and convergence of programmes and actions. At the same time, the excessively high
costs of value added taxes, energy and product certifications seem to disadvantage local companies
in international competition.
The presence of the government within the sector is strong and certainly fosters innovation and
improvement of skills: through the OFPPT, the government provides paid continuing training courses
that seem to be appreciated and used by companies. There is an effort from the government to cover
around 80% of the expenses of the courses and it is asked to intervene, through ONSSA, to reduce
the informal market in favour of higher quality of the marketed products. ADA has launched an
incentive to increase competitiveness and visibility of local products both nationally and
internationally.
International regulations and standards
As much as national regulations and incentives affect companies’ abilities to enter and operate in the
market, international regulations and standards act as a main driver for international trade and
exports, and can affect businesses in different directions. For example, strict regulations introduced
in various countries on pesticide remnants and other pollutants in food obliged companies exporting
their products to adopt more environmentally sustainable solutions. In general, regulations introduced
in export-bound countries prompt companies in Morocco to focus on compliance to ensure they are
still able to export their products.
Aridity and efficient water management
In 2018 and 2019, Morocco was hit by severe droughts and variability which affected water security
and hence food and energy security. Such a factor affects crops, in particular those with the highest
consumption of water such as tomatoes. Other kinds of crops, such as olive tree cultivation,
consume less water and, in general, are more resistant to water scarcity. From a production point of
view, aridity affects both the quality and quantity of crops.
To cope with these environmental factors, local farmers have introduced some innovations: the
development of new irrigation technologies that allow for more efficient use of water (drip irrigation);
the construction of wells to avoid drawing water directly from the main supply; and the introduction of
new varieties of plants that have higher resistance to water stress. The latter, where implemented,
are largely supported and facilitated by the research work done by INRA.
Despite this progress, only a small area of the land is irrigated using drip systems (approximately
7%), as efficient irrigation techniques incur high costs. Extending the reach of water management
systems to remote areas will have an immediate effect in terms of job creation, while the diffusion of
technological advances will surely benefit the entire sector.
Climate change
Besides globalisation, climate change is considered the other factor that will most affect agri-food
companies. It has important repercussions on production, both in terms of quality and crop
productivity. It will worsen the problem of water scarcity, while higher temperatures will have
devastating effects on agriculture, particularly on the cultivation of olives; also, new plant diseases
could spread more easily. In recent years, Moroccan agriculture has seen important and successful
advancements in terms of water management; still, given the expected worsening of climate
conditions, keeping at the frontier of technological evolution in terms of irrigation systems would be
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 43

--- Page 47 ---

extremely helpful, as will be the study of new varieties of crops and of plant protection techniques.
Numerous water policies and investments have been launched and developed over recent decades.
Morocco has 145 large dams with a capacity exceeding 18.67 billion cubic metres and several
thousand boreholes and wells to capture groundwater. The Green Morocco Plan and water-related
policies and programmes have helped to increase the irrigated area to 1.6 million hectares (in which
610 000 hectares are equipped with drip irrigation systems). The programmes focused on efficiency
and economy of water and energy by shifting from traditional irrigation schemes to drip irrigation
systems. In addition to IAV Hassan II, there are two other higher education schools that have the
mandate to train engineers in water sectors: École Mohammadia des ingénieurs in Rabat and École
Hassania des travaux publics in Casablanca.
Energy efficiency is becoming increasingly important. Some companies are introducing improved
energy efficiency systems, and the use of alternative energy sources is often considered. In the
future most companies will move towards alternative technologies, considering the current high cost
of energy and the absence of traditional energy sources in the country. Photovoltaic solutions will
likely be adopted; unfortunately, up to now, they have not been accessible to many companies
because of their price.
Environmental sustainability and greening of the economy
Some companies are starting to adopt alternative ways of producing energy in order to reduce the
impact of humans on the environment, both in terms of emissions and deforestation. The energy
production from biomass obtained from olive waste is an example. In general, there is increased
awareness of the need to reduce waste from the production processes. Reuse of waste materials
that are generated along the chain is increasingly widespread among companies. Due to the
increasing importance of exports to the sector, logistics is another area where improvements in
resource use, efficiency and waste management will be needed.
Organic farming, which is not yet widespread in Morocco, should contribute to the reduction of
emissions, better soil and water quality, lower energy consumption and better energy efficiency.
Génération Green has set the goal of having 100 000 hectares of organic farming by 2030. In
addition to producing higher quality and healthier foods, biological production aims to reduce the
environmental impact of crops, through the non-use of fertilisers and chemicals in the soil.
Companies are gradually implementing green strategies in their businesses and they are moving
towards healthier and more respectful (for the environment and for future generations) solutions. In
fact, the Department of Environment has within its National Strategy for Sustainable Development
launched a programme for the government to respect the environment and ensure green solutions
and approaches39.
From an international point of view, to prevent countries importing products that come from highly
polluted areas, some restrictive policies have been implemented. Such restrictions certainly
encourage the adoption of low-emission technologies. There would be willingness to innovate, even
on the part of small-scale farmers, if incentives were sufficient to cover the costs of new
technologies.

Crop improvement and new plant varieties
Crop improvement through genetics and biotechnology is developing in Morocco. This driver mainly
deals with issues related to abiotic stress as well as to diseases and plant infestations while
enhancing crop productivity and quality. In a country where water resources are already critical,
the protection of plants from diseases is a topic of great and growing interest. More and more
companies are trying to experiment with new plant varieties that are more resistant to external
events. This has led to the research of new varieties of crops that are more heat tolerant and
resistant to water stress. Institutions such as INRA are working on the R&D of new varieties of plants
and are supporting companies. In general, by adopting a new variety of cultivation, productivity
increases: it allows better water efficiency and produces more with less water. To reduce diseases,
some companies also use ecological techniques such as compost and essential oils.
Technical innovation
While technology has the potential to bring radical changes to the sector, from this first analysis of
data, the technological input does not seem to have achieved a breakthrough effect in the Moroccan
agri-food sector yet. Interviews have confirmed this trend. In the period from 2005 to 2015, the
innovations introduced were mainly aimed at coping with the climatic situation due to droughts and
climate change, such as more effective irrigation systems and new plant varieties. More recently,
technologies to improve production efficiency have started to be introduced, but mainly in large farms
(e.g. precision agriculture) or large plants (e.g. agricultural waste reused as fuel in sugar refineries).
Digitalisation was more widely adopted in e-commerce and marketing.
Productivity
One of the main goals of the measures adopted through the Green Morocco Plan was to enhance
productivity. Cultivated areas have been increased, and in addition to innovations that have been
introduced by the companies, training courses, events and activities to support production have been
promoted nationwide. Plants for the transformation process, based on more modern production
processes, have also been powered up in the period.
Quality and upgrade along the value chain
The issue of improving the quality of products and introducing structural quality control actions have
been indicated during interviews as a key element for the future of the sector. While the Green
Morocco Plan focused on productivity, the subsequent Génération Green’s focus is on the
enhancement of production, hence the quality of products. The ONSSA certification is necessary for
products to be on the market while other types of certifications are still difficult to access by some
companies due to the high associated costs.
The quality issue is clearly dependent on technological inputs: at the farm level, precision agriculture
will help minimise the use of pesticides; in subsequent steps of the value chain, techniques for
accurate tests – for traceability, proper storage and conservation – will all be necessary to guarantee
quality standards to the final customer. In this sense, some regions and some value chains start with
greater organisation than others; for example, citrus is an established crop with large farms that
could invest in technology to guarantee international quality standards, while olive oil or red meat are
newer parts of the chain, with a lower degree of organisation and varying degrees of readiness of the
various companies. In the same way, government support and customer awareness are equally
important. There is the need to enforce legislation on quality controls, support better management
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 45

--- Page 49 ---

and organisation of old-fashioned value chains, incentivise quality, and encourage consumers to
move from the informal market to certified and healthier products.
A related action to upgrade the positioning of Moroccan products towards the higher price segment
of the value chain is that of promoting organic farming, identity preservation of food, and the
development of niche products or applications. Organic farming (i.e. certified) and its counterpart
agroecology agriculture (based on agreement between small producers) are growing but need
recognisable labels and more support to reduce costs and reach customers. A relevant factor
highlighted during a focus group was that of preserving the identity of foods, which need traceability
technologies but also skills and competences on how to protect and enhance local products. Finally,
a higher selling value and better employment can be achieved through niche products, such as argan
oil, avocados, or low-calorie sugar, or niche applications, such as the use of oil as an ingredient for
the cosmetic industry.
Changes in consumer tastes
Companies often pointed out that changing consumer tastes led to the development of new
consumption patterns and therefore a reshaping of business. Until recently, some types of food
products were made at home (subsistence economy), and the most widely marketed products were
fresh ones. According to the interviews, due to the development of urbanisation, women entering the
labour market and more recently Covid-19, the demand for processed products has increased. Fresh
products are experiencing a slowdown in consumption in favour of long-life products. This leads
companies to want to satisfy the new needs of customers by offering products that are aligned with
their preferences. Some sectors such as pastry and gastronomy have developed recently so there is
a strong demand for new competences.
The increasing demand for healthier food is growing worldwide and this creates opportunities for
exported goods; in any case, industries are obliged to adapt and introduce innovation to achieve
greener and more sustainable production. In the domestic market, there is also growing interest in
ethical, environmental and nutritional aspects, especially among the educated middle classes and
younger generations. Yet, various companies complained about a lack of awareness in the general
Moroccan population about issues such as quality (also due to the higher prices of quality local
goods).
4.2 Preliminary findings on the impact of Covid-19
Covid-19 has revealed various weaknesses in the sector. Agri-food companies and farms have been
hit to different degrees according to the product range of their businesses. The impact of Covid-19 on
productivity is linked to a company’s capacity to adapt, but it also depends on the type of production
and services offered by the company. For instance, Fenagri reported a 30% fall in the number of
transactions for the food processing industry in April 2020, with specific products experiencing
particular contractions in demand (for instance, chocolate and drinks and beverages dropped by 65%
and biscuits by 60%)40. On the other hand, farmers producing for the local market were allowed to
continue working and have not seen a reduction in their business; certain products such as citrus and
yeast have even seen increased demand during the crisis.
40 www.agrimaroc.ma/agroalimentaire-produits-locaux-maroc/
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 46

--- Page 50 ---

Exports have been damaged, as have all products dependent on imported goods (e.g. cereals) or
raw materials (e.g. chocolate, canned drinks). Agri-food supply chains have been adversely affected.
The logistics and distribution processes have been affected the most. Major difficulties were faced by
those companies engaged in international trade (both imports and exports) and by those companies
which had difficulties reaching some cities due to temporary restrictions. Activities that included
training services, product sales and catering directly at farms also suffered negative consequences:
while in the first case the activities were suspended, as far as sales and catering were concerned,
the companies re-packaged their product offer (e.g. self-service, delivery). As far as production is
concerned, it never stopped completely but it has not always continued at the same output level.
The government has intervened with support to both unemployed people and companies in the
sector, especially for small enterprises to help them retain employees. Although labour demand has
not diminished, since the sector is strategic for food security during the crisis, in certain cases labour
supply reduced due to concerns about infection from Covid-19 in crowded working places.
In some cases, new business models have been adopted by companies that work with fresh or
rapidly perishable products (e.g. milk or yeast). Companies have started to increasingly sell their
products in supermarkets and hypermarkets, and have shifted towards the production and marketing
of longer-life products.
It is a common belief that the crisis has raised people’s awareness of health-related issues.
Customers are shifting to healthier and organic food more than before. The Covid-19 pandemic has
also boosted the use of digital technologies in the sector. Digital solutions have been adopted for
training purposes such as distance training and e-learning activities, and to create a digital platform
where farmers can sell products online to reach new customers. Many interviewees believe that
Covid-19 has accelerated the adoption and introduction of digital technologies and that this, in the
long term, will benefit the entire sector.
4.3 The role of innovation
The following discussion is about technology as a driver of change. It is important to note that the
focus is not about technology per se but about its potential to influence, through its adoption, the
demand for employment and skills. From a methodological point of view, the interest is in the
functional use of technology rather than on its performance or actual content. All technology exists to
fulfil a purpose for the user, to solve a real-life problem, or provide an advantage. In the theory of
engineering design, the purpose is referred to as the function of the technology.
The current literature on the future of work and skills focuses more on the potential of new
technologies, but existing empirical evidence is limited on the actual impact of technology use in
companies. By looking at the functional use of technology – i.e. the actual problem it solves or the
actual beneficial uses it enables – it is possible to study its real impact in the real world. Moreover,
even if a specific technology is not eventually adopted, if the need expressed by its functional use is
real, in the long term another substitute technology will appear. In this sense, the functional approach
allows for an understanding of the obsolescence and/or resilience of certain jobs or occupations and
forecasting or even designing the shifts occurring between jobs, and the trajectory of skills from one
job to another.
The first analysis is a general one and concerns the competitive potential provided by technological
development. One indicator of the innovative capacity of a country is given by its capability to invent,
expressed by the patents filed by companies and research centres. Of course, this applies not only in
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 47

--- Page 51 ---

quantity but also in quality, but even the sheer number of patents provides a useful measure of
innovation.
Figure 4.3A shows the patents filed over the years in the agri-food sector in Morocco, whereas
Figure 4.3B compares that data with the total number of filed patents in Morocco. Figure 4.4
compares the number of agri-food patents filed in Morocco with the total number of patents
worldwide related to the agri-food sector, expressed as a percentage.
Note: the red shading covers the last year and a half of each graph, since the number of filed patents
cannot be considered final, due to the 18-month period of secrecy occurring before a patent
application is published. Considering the last two years in the analysis without keeping this in mind
would lead to wrong and distorted interpretations.
FIGURE 4.3A MOROCCAN AGRI-FOOD PATENTS OVER THE YEARS (BLUE LINE);
4.3B COMPARISON WITH ALL MOROCCAN PATENTS (GREEN LINE)
As can be seen from Figure 4.3B, except for the period 2002 to 2006 (due to the economic crisis),
innovation has been growing in the country. With reference to the period 2007 to 2014, patent filing
increased substantially. Specifically related to the agri-food industry, the trend in filed patents follows
the general one. The year 2013 saw a peak in agri-food sector patents, with it accounting for 24.6%
of the country’s total filed patents. As the desk research reveals, the positive (or negative) trends are
also the result of actions from the government, e.g. the Green Morocco Plan. The decrease from
2014 onwards is likely to be related to a period of economic instability.

--- Page 52 ---

The number of patents filed worldwide has been growing exponentially over the past 15 years; the
benchmark for the country, expressed as the percentage of Moroccan patents compared with all
worldwide, shows that Morocco has usually been able to keep pace with worldwide innovation since
the 1990s, except during two periods of economic instability which led to a drop in inventive activity.
Thus, the issue is not the country’s capacity to innovate, but rather in sustaining it consistently over
time.
4.4 Evolution of the technology landscape
Identifying new technologies
Various data sources were analysed through text mining techniques, providing insights into the
ongoing changes in the technology landscape of the Moroccan agri-food sector. First of all, the vast
majority of innovation is occurring in the subsectors listed in Table 4.1, where it is reasonable to
expect, in the near future, a change in the demand for both new jobs and new skills.
TABLE 4.1 FAMILIES (CLUSTERS) OF MOROCCAN AGRI-FOOD PATENTS (RANKED FROM
HIGHEST TO LOWEST NUMBER OF PATENTS), 1990‒2020
Number of patents Cluster
151 Irrigation system
148 Biochemistry
121 Pesticides and fertilisers
121 Processing and extraction of raw materials
113 Packaging and transportation
105 Horticulture
69 Microbiology
63 Hardware and software
Out of the eight patent families listed in the table, the first three represent 75% of the total number of
Morocco’s filed patents in the sector. Clusters are consistent with the analysis of the drivers of
change in Section 4.1, as well as with the idea of the functional use of technology. For example, the
irrigation system cluster is linked to those drivers of change that are related to aridity, climate change
and environmental sustainability of the sector. Clusters such as biochemistry, fertilisers and
pesticides may reveal the development of products specifically related to biological agriculture, while
the packaging and transport cluster is linked to globalisation and downstream activities, such as the
distribution and commercialisation of products.
Regarding the number of filed patents over the years, it is also possible to create temporal trends for
each cluster, as shown in Figure 4.5. Compared with Table 4.1, the representation of trend clusters
provides a more dynamic view. Furthermore, when addressing changes occurring in the sector,
trends are the key variable to analyse since they resemble the evolution of a specific concept.
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 49

--- Page 53 ---

FIGURE 4.5 TRENDS FOR SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGIES (BARS INDICATE RAW DATA, BLUE
LINE THE INTERPOLATION CURVE)
At first sight, the trends for each cluster seem to confirm the overall trends depicted in Figure 4.5: a
first period of patent submission activity during the 1990s, when particular clusters such as
biochemistry and packaging and transportation had a greater relevance in terms of filed patents, and
a second phase of growth when filed patents reached values even higher than those of the first
phase. In fact, even if this second period is characterised by an overall fluctuating trend, the majority
of clusters present a positive growth since 2010.
Moreover, Figure 4.5 confirms that the clusters at the top of the list, from irrigation systems to
pesticides and fertilisers, have been growing faster than the others in recent years. It is also
interesting to note that the trends for the hardware and software and microbiology clusters, although
in the bottom two positions in terms of absolute numbers, have been steadily growing over time.
As for the actual technologies that have been or are being introduced, the following list contains all
the most recent and most active ones within each of the above clusters, as determined from the text
mining analysis (please note that the same technology can appear in more clusters which will
increase its significance):
■ solar thermal devices (solar collector, heating devices, heat carrier medium),
■ chemical separation techniques (flash and column chromatography),

■ nanotechnologies.
Among the group of new technologies (at least new for the agri-food sector in Morocco) are all those
linked to irrigation technologies in actual fields and more efficient management of water: pumps for
irrigation systems, various types of valves, sealing solutions, and hydraulic systems. A second group
is related to the production side of the chain and issues related to automation technologies and
predictive maintenance. A third group relates to new varieties, such as genetics and biochemistry,
green chemistry and chemical separation techniques such as the various solutions regarding
chromatography techniques.
Other technologies relate to the tracking and integration of the supply chain: image acquisition,
various types of sensors, and automatic measurement devices for packaging and transportation.
Interest in greener energy has led to research on technologies such as solar thermal devices,
including solar collectors, heating devices, heat carrier mediums and the introduction of telemetry to
improve energy efficiency in factories and offices.
Finally, some technologies are related to automation at the transformation level of the chain. These
include robotic arms, solutions for production line automation, wireless technologies, preventive
maintenance and information systems development.
41 Extrusion is the process of forcing soft mixed ingredients through an opening in a perforated plate or die
designed to produce the required shape.

On the potential impact of technologies
The interviews with key stakeholders and companies confirmed the relevance of all the technologies
presented in the previous section. The discussions also highlighted which technologies are more
likely to come on stream in the foreseeable future and transform elements of the agri-food sector.
Even though there is awareness that the introduction of new technologies can improve
competitiveness and productivity at all stages of the value chain (e.g. yield, durability, system
irrigation, fertilisation processes and soil conservation), these technologies, except in large
enterprises, have rarely been adopted to date.
The sector is moving at two different speeds: the first group of farms (the minority) is modern and
evolving by adopting digital and mechanical technologies, sometimes imported from other countries;
the second group (the majority) is composed of farms that are smaller in dimension, still work with
traditional methods, and are facing multiple challenges with respect to new technologies. As a result,
and despite incentives from the government, precision agriculture solutions or even drip irrigation
systems are not common. The high cost of the technologies means they are out of reach of many
players in the sector, but it is also the case that some in the sector are wedded to more traditional
systems of production.
To support the transition, cooperatives and institutions like ONCA are the bridge between INRA and
small farmers and are responsible for transferring technologies and competences. While INRA
carries out research, ONCA directly interacts with farmers. Also thanks to this support, those value
chains that have started to invest in processing have reached high levels of technological
development.
New technologies can bring enhancements at all stages of the value chain, from production in the
field to market distribution. Many of the new technologies and approaches most commonly
mentioned in the interviews have the potential to change the sector if adopted. The key ones are
listed below.
■ Introduce drip irrigation and sensor-based irrigation to counter water scarcity and improve
production. Parts of the country are not irrigated and reaching remote regions even with
standard irrigation techniques will have a profound impact on production and job creation.
■ Look to make use of the ‘smartification’ of production by adopting forecasting, modelling and
simulation technologies alongside precision agriculture solutions.
■ Invest in more specific machines (e.g. harvesters) for farms to increase yields and reduce
labour-intensive work by farmers.
■ Adopt production methodologies derived from best practices developed for industrial processes
to increase efficiency and yield.
■ Construct more greenhouses run with energy efficient systems.
■ Use technologies for the transformation processes and quality enhancement of production, for
example with solar dryers for dates and apricots, pasteurisation machines for milk, or selection
of input seeds for cereals.
■ Use technologies to test, diagnose and profile products, at all steps along the value chain, to
ensure traceability and quality of food up to the final distribution stage. Certifications and labels
to recognise/confirm the product’s identity would also support sales and increase consumer
loyalty.
■ Reintroduce/reuse production waste within the production cycle to improve revenue for farmers
and reduce environmental impact (e.g. reuse of agricultural waste for heating).
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 52

--- Page 56 ---

■ Introduce more efficient technologies for energy production in order to be more environmentally
friendly and reduce costs.
■ Digitalise production with digital communications and IT solutions, both hardware and software,
and sensors.
■ Digitalise sales with e-commerce but also social media activity for marketing.
Improvements in production processes and the push to higher quality and food safety standards are
largely dependent on investments in new technologies. Agropoles play an important role in the frame
of the partnership with universities for transferring technologies. For the future, it is expected that
ONCA will have significantly more resources for transferring technologies through Génération Green.
Moreover, the next generation of smart young farmers are eager to increase the use of new
technologies in the sector.
4.5 Main findings
■ Many factors have influenced the evolution of the sector, from greater integration into a more
globalised market to customers’ changing tastes, to the increased interest in the green economy
and sustainability. The complex interplay of factors shaping the sector calls for long-term
strategies.
■ Numerous technologies are coming on stream which are likely to transform the agri-food sector.
Many technologies show a positive adoption trend with implications for related jobs profiles.
■ According to interviewees, certain technologies have the potential to completely disrupt and
reshape production and value chains. Economic support and changes in the mindsets of
producers are needed to boost wider adoption, especially in smaller enterprises.
■ The following factors all have the potential to create new jobs in the sector: growing trend of
innovation, increasing quality of production, the creation of niche products or markets with higher
value added, the greening of production, and the high volumes of exports.

5. ONGOING CHANGES IN JOBS AND SKILLS
DEMAND
KEY ISSUES
■ An analysis of the main occupational profiles used in the sector and of the evolution of
the skill content of selected occupations as a result of the changes occurring in the
sector.
■ An analysis of new tasks and functions which have emerged in the jobs and/or
occupations in this sector, as well as of the ones that have disappeared (or are likely to
disappear).
■ The impact of the drivers of change on labour and skills demand in the sector, and
whether such changes require higher levels of the same skills or completely new sets
of skills.
While the previous chapter looked at the drivers of change in the agri-food sector and the associated
technological changes, this chapter focuses on the implications of these changes. From both the
data mining and the interviews, two groups of occupations emerged as likely to be increasingly
sought in relation to the technological changes being introduced into agri-food: (i) technical or
technology-related occupations (see Section 5.1); and (ii) business services and related occupations
(see Section 5.2). Section 5.3 describes new skills needs. In addition, attention is given to those jobs
which may become obsolescent. Overall, the analysis reveals that significant changes are taking
place, and will continue to take place, in job profiles resulting from the technological changes
described in the previous chapter.
5.1 Technology-related occupations
Identifying emerging jobs and skills needs
The incumbents of technology-related occupations comprise those who manage and use a given
technology. The key assumption is that the growing interest in a certain technology (as expressed by
patents filed, discussion in scientific papers, and so on) is associated with a growing need for skills
associated with the use of that technology. The scale of skills demand will depend on the adoption or
diffusion of the technology, which may vary for a number of reasons (e.g. capital constraints), and the
strategic decisions companies make regarding the organisation of work.
There are various possible ways to link the information on technologies derived from text mining to
the possible future skills needs. The following procedure was used. The relevant technologies
extracted from the literature (see Section 4.3) were compared, using semantic matching algorithms
(i.e. algorithms able to find semantic connections between different concepts based on contextual
information), to the occupations listed by the European classification system ESCO.
Each occupation in the ESCO database includes a description and a list of competences, skills and
knowledge considered relevant (either essential or optional) for that occupation. The semantic
algorithm looks for matches of each technology with all the concepts associated with an occupation.
When a match is found, the occupation is considered associated with the technology. The entire
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 54

--- Page 58 ---

procedure is automated by using ESCO’s API, which allows occupational data to be downloaded.
Table 5.1 provides a few examples of the matching process.

Instead of starting from technologies (as extracted from patents) and then matching these with job
profiles, an alternative methodology consists of extracting profiles directly from papers about
Morocco’s agri-food sector. In detail, the way this can be achieved is by using a list of skills, tools and
technologies which can be found in the O*NET classification (this information can be easily
downloaded from the online database) and then each one is searched for in the text of scientific
papers. Once skills, tools and technologies have been extracted from the latter, it is then possible to
refer to the O*NET occupations.
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 55

--- Page 59 ---

The following lists the technical professional and associate professional jobs which comprise ISCO
(International Standard Classification of Occupations) occupation groups 21 – science and
engineering professionals, and 31 – science and engineering associate professionals. The list
emerged from the data mining (merging matches from both ESCO and O*NET). Please note that the
list does not imply a ranking of relevance or intensity.
■ Agronomist ■ Water engineering technician
■ Biochemical engineer ■ Wastewater treatment technician
■ Sensor engineering technician ■ Water plant technician
■ Bioengineer ■ Thermal engineer
■ Wastewater engineer ■ Drainage engineer
■ Fluid power engineer ■ Photonics engineering technician
■ Water engineer ■ Optoelectronic engineer
■ Hydroelectric operator ■ Optical engineer
■ Geneticist ■ Optoelectronic engineering technician
■ Biochemist ■ Water treatment systems operator
■ Biochemistry technician ■ Wastewater treatment operator
■ Microbiologist ■ Microelectronics engineering technician
■ Mechanical engineer ■ Energy systems engineer
■ Electrical engineer ■ Industrial pharmacist
■ Solar energy engineer ■ Chromatographer
■ Renewable energy engineer ■ Chemistry technician
■ Energy engineer ■ Instrumentation engineer
■ Sensor engineer ■ Instrumentation engineering technician
■ Energy assessor ■ Chemical engineer
The occupations listed above can be grouped according to two main branches of the occupational
classification:
■ science and engineering professionals divided in two main groups: life science professionals
such as geneticists, biochemists, microbiologists and agronomists; and engineering
professionals such as mechanical engineers, fluid power engineers, and solar and renewable
energy engineers;
■ associate professionals such as physical and engineering science technicians (e.g. sensor and
water engineering technician, chromatographers and microelectronics engineering technician),
process control technicians (e.g. water plant technician and wastewater treatment technician)
and life science technicians (e.g. biochemistry technician).
The role of agronomist has always been associated with agri-food and it implies that even the
introduction of new technologies will not diminish the need for this profession on which the sector has
been historically dependent. The presence of mechanical engineers and electrical engineers shows,
in the former, that there is still the traditional link with mechanical tools both in agricultural and
industrial fields, while the latter may indicate a shift towards the adoption of electrical solutions in
production processes. The largest group of professions is related to the topic of water management.
Besides the more generic engineering professions, there are specific profiles for wastewater
management and for the use of water as an energy source. In this regard, some professions on the
list are related to the management of energy, i.e. those that explicitly refer to renewable energy and
solar energy. Professions related to the introduction of sensors also emerge which, although no
longer pioneering, can still be relatively new and confirm a possible development for the sector. In
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 56

--- Page 60 ---

this sense, these should also be considered profiles for the adoption of optical solutions in the food
industry sector.
As well as looking at professional and associate professional occupations, i.e. highly skilled workers,
it is also possible to look at lower-skilled occupations, in particular service workers (ISCO 5 – service
and sales workers), skilled trades workers (ISCO 7 – craft and related trades workers), machine
operators (ISCO 8 – plant and machine operators and assemblers), and agricultural and transport
labourers (ISCO 9 – elementary occupations). The following occupations emerged as being related
to technological change in agri-food:
■ Pump operator ■ Tower operator
■ Heat sealing machine operator ■ Pipe welder
■ Concrete pump operator ■ Crop production worker
■ Fluid power technician ■ Solar energy technician
■ Water network operative ■ Precision mechanic
■ Irrigation system installer ■ Machinery assembler
■ Fruit and vegetable picker ■ Machinery mechanic
■ Pipeline pump operator ■ Drainage worker
■ Land-based machinery operator ■ Forestry equipment operator
■ Waterway construction labourer ■ Precision instrument assembler
As with the highly skilled professional group, it is possible to notice a similar distribution at the lower-
skilled levels. In fact, there are profiles related to the mechanical, hydraulic and energy fields.
However, low-skilled profiles do not mention electrical professions or those in the field of scientific
research. It is also interesting to note the presence of elementary professions within the sector: fruit
and vegetable picker, waterway construction labourer, crop production worker, drainage worker and
aquaculture harvesting worker.
Skills required by technological professions
As well as looking at the occupations associated with technological change, there is a need to know
which skills within those occupations are likely to be in demand. One can achieve this by looking at
the skills listed for each occupation in ESCO. This is a straightforward exercise (for example, a
sensor engineering technician must know how to assemble sensors, test sensors etc.). The process
is illustrated in Table 5.2.

There are limitations to using ESCO. In many cases, it lists general skills (e.g. test sensors), while
specific competences (e.g. knowledge of different types of sensor devices), which effectively allow
deeper detail, are less well covered. Additionally, the competence level required (e.g. how much
knowledge/ability in a sensor device is required for each of the various occupations it appears in) is
another critical factor which is not specified in existing classification systems such as ESCO. In
addition to this, the technologies likely to be increasingly adopted in agri-food may result in demand
for people to work in jobs or occupations which are new and not classified in ESCO, ISCO or other
job classifications.
To address the limitation described above and obtain a more complete picture of the knowledge
needed to master a given technology, additional information was obtained from Wikipedia (chosen
for its accessibility, the comprehensive amount of information it contains, and the structured way it
presents information). More precisely, for every topic (most recurrent terms found in patents) the
corresponding Wikipedia page was downloaded using web scraping. The content of the pages and of
its associated content tree was then semantically matched with the various related occupations in
order to find those technical concepts that seemed to correlate with each one of them. It is thus
possible to provide a more in-depth analysis of the specific skills that will be required in various
technical jobs (as shown in Table 5.3). As in the previous example, the sensor technology has been
matched to the occupation of sensor engineering technician and its associated skills (according to
ESCO), but here the occupation has been further linked to more detailed information about the skills
required to master the use of sensors.

It is important to note that not all topics/technologies which emerged from the patent analysis were
matched to ESCO competences and occupations. For example, the technology chromatography did
not find a direct match. It is another indication that existing classifications may not yet encompass
references to all new technologies.
That said, to complement the above analyses, job profiles related to technologies can be extracted
from online job postings in an automated way, i.e. through web scraping. More specifically, it is
possible to search for all job offers (for this task the global employment website Monster.com was
used) which mention, for example, chromatography, and extract details of the occupations where this
technology is mentioned. Since this approach leads to results which are not readily cross-classified
with standard occupational classifications (e.g. ESCO or ISCO), it was not pursued further in this
study, but Table 5.4 illustrates the possible outcomes using the example of chromatography.

Ranking occupations according to potential demand
In the case of technology-related occupations or jobs, it is possible to use data mining results not just
to list occupations but also to estimate their relative relevance in the future labour market based on
technological trends. To do this, an assumption is made about the relevance of an occupation
depending on:
■ the technological transversality of the occupation, i.e. its importance grows if it has skills related
to more than one technology or topic;
■ if the associated skills are essential or optional (as defined in the ESCO classification);
■ the weight of the technologies to which it has been matched, in terms of potential future use, as
expressed by the normalised number of patents it appears in.
To assign an importance value to each job profile, the three conditions must be intersected as shown
by the following formula:
Where:
The values of T are based on the analysis an extract of which is shown in Table 5.1, the values of E
ij ij
are based on a sensitivity analysis42, and the values for W are derived from the intensity of the signal
i
for the given technology derived from the patent analysis (see Section 4.3 and Figure 4.3). Once the
scores have been calculated for all occupations, a bar plot can provide a visual understanding of the
most relevant occupations in the agri-food sector.
The output is shown in Figure 5.1 (relevance scores are normalised and cut above 0.15). The
ranking is indicative of which job profiles are of potential interest but not for the exact order or score.
A full-scale analysis of the demand for jobs would require a deeper investigation and a range of
different approaches, and is beyond the scope of the present study. Yet it provides interesting
insights: from the plot it is clear that there will be a high demand for water plant technicians,
biochemical engineers, sensor engineering technicians, bioengineers and wastewater engineers,
among others. Occupations such as energy assessor will still be needed in the future but less so
than the above-mentioned occupations.
42 Sensitivity analysis is an iterative procedure for defining the ‘strength’ of the link between technology/topic and
job profile. In comparing the ranks obtained from the iterations, the lower value is set to 0.5 in order to generate
a rank that is consistent with the association between job profiles and technologies.
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 60

--- Page 64 ---

FIGURE 5.1 RANKING OF RELEVANCE FOR PROFESSIONAL AND ASSOCIATE
PROFESSIONAL OCCUPATIONS FROM ESCO (ON THE BASIS OF THE TECHNOLOGIES THEY
CORRELATE WITH)
A similar analysis can be repeated for trade workers and machine operators, with the same remarks
about the meaning and the limitations of the ranking. The output is shown in Figure 5.2 (relevance
scores are normalised and cut above 0.15). It is worth noting that if generally low-skilled occupations
receive a lower score compared to professional occupations, in this case some of them have a
higher relevance: pump operator, heat sealing machine operator and concrete pump operator seem
to receive a higher ranking than, for example, water plant technician and biochemical engineer.
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 61

--- Page 65 ---

FIGURE 5.2 RANKING OF RELEVANCE FOR MEDIUM-, LOW- AND VERY LOW-SKILLED
OCCUPATIONS FROM ESCO (ON THE BASIS OF THE TECHNOLOGIES THEY CORRELATE
WITH)
In addition, it is also possible to have a more detailed look at each occupation by analysing how they
differ from one another based on which ESCO competence they are connected to. For instance,
taking the agronomist, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, pump operator and solar energy
engineer, a bubble chart can be used to visualise which skills or sets of knowledge are associated
with the occupations, and how important these are based on the technology/topic to which they are
connected (see Figure 5.3). In the figure, the horizontal axis lists the five ESCO occupations which
are matched on the vertical axis with the competences ESCO associates with them. Each
competence is associated with a technology according to the procedure described at the beginning
of the section, and the size of the bubble at the intersection indicates the relevance of the technology
as determined by its occurrence in patents.
Figure 5.3 shows the distribution of competences across occupations. For example, it reveals that to
work in the agri-food sector, the electrical engineer needs to have skills related to sensors, digital
camera sensors and microsensors, robotics, instrumentation equipment, electric drivers and
computer technology. On the other hand, the mechanical engineer needs to have competences that
are mostly linked to the use of thermal and hydraulic systems.
It is also interesting to note that the agronomist, according to ESCO at least, seems to be a
profession with a rather small set of competences. However, the increasing relevance of techniques
such as precision agriculture for agronomic production hints at the fact that ESCO classification is not
sufficient to define the skills range of future agronomists: it is very likely (and trends in other countries
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 62

--- Page 66 ---

confirm this assumption) that this occupation will become more complex and will need to possess a
wider range of competences, from knowledge of sensors to the basics of data science.
FIGURE 5.3 COMPARING FIVE JOB PROFILES IN TERMS OF THEIR SKILLS (ACCORDING TO
ESCO CLASSIFICATION OF OCCUPATIONS AND RELATED COMPETENCES), AND WHICH
COMPETENCES ARE THE MOST RELEVANT FOR EACH OCCUPATION (BASED ON THE
ASSOCIATION WITH TECHNOLOGIES PROVIDED BY PATENT ANALYSIS)
Finally, the ranking procedure applied to patents and ESCO occupations (shown in Figures 5.1 and
5.2) can also be applied to scientific papers and O*NET to obtain the results shown in Figure 5.4.
This chart has a similar purpose to Figures 5.1 and 5.2, but instead of aggregating all contributions to
create an overall ranking, an alternative visualisation has been chosen, showing the time trend of the
references to each occupation. The size of each dot in the chart is proportional to the strength of the
signal associated with a given occupation in a given year.

FIGURE 5.4 O*NET OCCUPATIONS AND THEIR GROWTH OVER THE YEARS IN THE
MOROCCAN AGRI-FOOD SECTOR (AS EXPRESSED BY THEIR OCCURRENCE IN SCIENTIFIC
PAPERS)
The information presented in Figure 5.4 summarises what emerged from previous analyses.
Information system technology had already emerged as one of the most recurring topics in Table 5.1.
Figure 5.4 seems to confirm this conclusion, since profiles related to geospatial information scientists
and technologists and geographic information system technicians seem to be growing in importance.
The fact that the number of soil and plant scientists and chemical engineers is also increasing can be
a reasonable and expected result, since we have seen that papers and websites often relate to
aridity, fertilisers, pesticides, biochemistry, microbiology, genetics, chemistry and crop improvement.
The growing trend of the profiles such as environmental economists, environmental compliance
inspectors and environmental engineers is linked to the climate change and environmental
sustainability drivers found in the paper analysis.
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 64

--- Page 68 ---

Other occupations which emerged through this last analysis are: computer technology profiles (such
as computer programmers, computer network architects and computer hardware engineers) and
data warehouse specialist (connected with data acquisition and analysis and digital communication
found in paper analysis); supply chain managers, storage and distribution managers and all logistics-
related profiles (globalisation driver emerged during previous paper analysis); and food scientists and
technologists. Some occupations do not seem to have well-defined trends and only appear in recent
years and in very low numbers, but this does not mean that they are not gaining importance. For
example, solar energy system engineers, energy engineers, water/wastewater engineers and water
resource specialists are all profiles related to topics that emerged both from papers and patents.
The above discussion highlights which job profiles are often in demand and thus resilient to change
or even favoured by such change, and which job profiles are currently in lower demand but are
emerging as likely to be more and more relevant. At the same time, the blue dots in Figure 5.4 depict
those profiles with no propensity to being substituted by automation, while red dots show those
profiles with a higher propensity for substitution (purple indicates profiles in between). In this regard,
it is possible to see how the profiles belonging to farmworkers and labourers (i.e. elementary
professions according to ISCO classification) have a high risk of being substituted by machines in the
near future and the number of such workers will likely decrease, although it is difficult to quantify by
how much.
Summing up trends for technology-related occupations
To sum up, as already stated, data for Figures 5.1, 5.2 and 5.4 is indicative of those job profiles
which are likely to be associated with technological change in the future in agri-food. According to
both the data analysis and the interviews with stakeholders and companies, the technology-related
job profiles most sought after at present are as follows, grouped by similar types:
■ data analysts43, computer programmers, computer network architects, computer hardware
engineers and data warehousing specialists;
■ agronomist, soil and plant scientists, and agricultural engineers;
■ geospatial information scientist and technologists, and geographic information system
technicians;
■ quality control engineers, food scientists and technologists, engineers in food management and
food science;
■ chemical engineers, biofuel processing technicians, biochemical engineers, bioengineers,
microbiologists, biochemistry technicians, geneticists and pharmacists;
■ various other branches of engineering: mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, sensor
engineers and optoelectronic engineers;
■ various types of blue-collar or specialised workers: farm equipment mechanics and service
technicians, pump (and other irrigation systems) operators, agricultural equipment operators (in
particular special drivers for agricultural machines such as tractors or harvesters), fruit and
vegetable pickers, and crop production workers.
The variety of job profiles listed above – including many professions which can be considered
traditional to the agricultural sector, such as agronomists, food specialists and soil and plant
scientists – prove that technology is reshaping all activities and processes. It was noted during
43 The data analyst profile in particular is not only related to the ongoing digitalisation process but also to the
need to use specific information from data to support strategic decisions.
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 65

--- Page 69 ---

the interviews that certain agricultural job profiles, although traditional, are nevertheless hard to find,
such as horticultural experts, as are skills in specific tasks such as branching and harvesting.
Profiles that represent a bridge between different fields are important in the agri-food sector. For
example, an agronomist has competences in upstream activities, since they have a basis in
agriculture, and understand the downstream processes of transformation.
The analysis (both from data and from interviews) also projected into the near future: due to the
climatic condition of the country and the worldwide movement on reducing emissions, and to the
need to increase competitiveness, the following professions are expected to be even more sought
after:
■ environmental economists, environmental compliance inspectors, environmental engineers,
solar and renewable energy engineers, thermal engineers, energy systems engineers, energy
assessors and experts in energy efficiency;
■ water/wastewater engineers, water resource specialists, water plant technicians, fluid power
engineers, pump operators, fluid power technicians, water network operatives, irrigation system
installers and pipeline pump operators;
■ metrologists and other associated professions (experts in metrology are considered by many a
necessary addition to keep pursuing more demanding quality control and enforcement);
■ manufacturing and packaging managers;
■ research laboratory officers: these are required in the R&D departments of companies to ensure
a connection between research and production and increase the innovativeness of the sector;
■ nutritionist engineers, who work on the technological processes and at the same time have
competences in commercial aspects, knowing food habits, consumer preferences and market
trends. This is a new profile that still does not exist in Morocco. They will also be needed to
develop more value added products.
The data analysis also detected some job profiles which might currently only employ relatively few
people but are mentioned with increasing frequency over time. These include:
■ supply chain managers, storage and distribution managers, logisticians, logistic managers,
logistics engineers, transportation vehicle, equipment and system inspectors, and commercial,
industrial and manufacturing engineers/designers.
Finally, there are those job profiles where demand may be diminishing because their tasks can be
easily automated. These include:
■ farmworkers and labourers, and geographic information system technicians.
The findings provided indicate how technology will shape the competences of jobs. It is this degree of
detail which is important to those who are responsible for anticipating future skills demand and
designing training programmes. But it is not just the more technical jobs which need to be
considered. As the next section reveals, the jobs of those involved in a range of business services
will also be affected in the agri-business sector.
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 66

--- Page 70 ---

5.2 Business services and related occupations
The analysis also identified a second category of profiles: non-technological jobs more related to
business aspects such as management, marketing and sales, and export and trade. Such
professions, which are related to particular agri-food subsectors rather than technologies, are
relevant to the business models that companies adopt and the way they organise production. These
professions affect the adoption and use of technology in agriculture.
The same data mining analysis used to identify technology-related jobs was used to identify the
following business service occupations (from both ESCO and O*NET):
■ renewable energy consultant, ■ horticulture production team leader,
■ renewable energy sales representative, ■ fruit production team leader,
■ agronomic crop production team leader, ■ horticulture production manager.
In the above list, given the lower number of entries, high- and medium-skilled occupations have been
grouped together. The list spans from business professionals and associated professionals (ISCO
Group 24 – business and administration professionals and ISCO Group 33 – business and
administration associate professionals) to highly skilled profiles and team leaders (ISCO Group 61 –
market-oriented skilled agricultural workers, limited to organisational and planning roles) to medium-
skilled ones.
From the point of view of functions performed, two main distinct groups can be identified:
■ business and administration professionals and sales and purchasing agents; these are directly
related in the renewable energy sector;
■ market-oriented skilled agricultural workers such as team leaders dedicated to the organisation
and planning of scheduled production.
The relatively low numbers of business roles highlighted during the data analysis is an indication that
many occupations in management and sales will not feel the impact of new technologies. Rather,
they will be affected by other types of drivers of change, as indeed the interviews suggested.
Trends in skills levels and specialisation and the expected impact on employment
There are a wide variety of skills attached to the business service roles and even more than for
technological occupations. For instance, management roles tend to require relatively high-level skills,
while for salespeople, the skills requirements tend to be lower.
Given the relational nature of business occupations, there is a lower risk of a decrease in
employment due to automation. More likely, the technological input on the sales and management
processes will reshape tasks and competences but not replace the human factor. It may, however,
result in jobs becoming broader – i.e. covering a wider range of tasks – because technologies may
merely assist with tasks. Even though they are necessities, managerial and business development
roles tend to be less required in comparison with roles more closely linked to production. This trend
will likely increase as organisations become more structured. Access to international markets will
also require properly trained managers, as well as marketing and salespeople.

Attempts to rank occupations according to possible demand
The ranking of relevance – as provided by the correlation with technologies, according to the formula
reported in Section 5.1 – can be applied here to show which business professions are more likely to
be affected as a result of technology (Figure 5.5).
FIGURE 5.5 RANKING OF RELEVANCE FOR MANAGERS, SALESPEOPLE AND SERVICES
WORKERS FROM ESCO (ON THE BASIS OF THE TECHNOLOGIES THEY CORRELATE TO)
The ranking is indicative of which occupations or jobs are likely to be related to the technological
changes expected over the coming years, with profiles related to renewable energy more relevant
than the various team leader ones.
By considering the information provided in Figure 5.5 in the light of the information collected during
the interviews with key stakeholders and employers, the business occupations most likely to be in
demand are listed below.
■ Marketing, communication and commerce: Marketing activities have been indicated as
insufficiently covered by the existing workforce. Consumer demand and competition are pushing
companies towards new markets such as the African market, requiring marketing and
communication profiles that could deal with the changing scenario. At the same time, digital
marketing and e-commerce will be more relevant for business in the near future and experts able
to take advantage of such tools will be required in relevant numbers.
■ Project managers, operation managers and production team leaders: These types of roles are
connected on the one hand to the increasing need to adopt efficient processes, imported from
the industrial world, and on the other hand to the increasing relevance of logistics and
management of the supply chain.
Business and management roles are important in a sector such as agri-food where the integration
along the supply chain (horizontal integration) and within the same company (vertical integration)
characterises its complexity. The demand for marketing and sales-oriented profiles demonstrates the
need for companies operating in the sector to increase their visibility on sales channels (both
physical and virtual) in order to maximise the value of their products.

5.3 Emerging skills needs and skills obsolescence
New skills for existing jobs and new emerging professions
New competences are at the basis of the introduction of new technologies; in many cases, people in
existing occupations need to reshape their skill sets so they are able to deal with the challenges
ahead.
A clear example is given by commercial roles. Many interviewees pointed out that there is a general
need for experts in communication, marketing and negotiations in order to promote national products
in the global market. Nowadays, this implies more expertise in digital techniques, such as for social
media marketing and e-commerce, and thus new profiles for such occupations will emerge in the
country. Some value chains are already trying to digitalise their marketing and creating a unique
digital platform for the business-to-consumer market. It is important to fill this competences gap: the
digital divide may hamper the success of many small companies, which may not be able to take full
advantage of the new opportunities and the incentives and tools provided by institutions and
associations.
In a similar way, the need to improve quality standards and introduce more sophisticated quality
controls often requires the employment of dedicated professionals, such as quality engineers;
regardless of this, existing production engineers and technicians need to learn about metrology
techniques, food management, quality control management and safety issues. Farmers will have to
learn how to grow and test their products to ensure quality and health standards.
Finally, some large enterprises have introduced digitalisation and mechanisation in their processes.
In these cases, they have started to look for new competences: new kinds of roles have been
created, such as qualified technicians that have some specialisation in automation and sensors.
Other professions are instead totally new, at least for Morocco. For example, the increasing demand
for processed foods creates new subsectors, such as pastry, gastronomy and cheese, which in turn
create a demand for new competences and job roles.
The need to enhance local products and preserve the identity of food requires expertise in testing
and traceability technologies, but also competences in intellectual property to protect such products,
both of which are new to the sector in Morocco. In the same way, experts in international certification
will be required to verify that production meets relevant criteria to be able to refer to something as
organic.
The trend towards a higher value added value chain creates the need for new professions. An
example of an emerging occupation is a nutritionist engineer, a new profile which creates a bridge
between the production processes and the market, having a knowledge both of technical aspects
and of consumer habits and preferences. Another case is that of the various experts needed to
create market niches, such as the use of olive oil in the cosmetic or pharmaceutical industry, or of its
waste products to produce energy. Other professions that will likely emerge in the future are the
profiles related to renewable energies, in particular solar energy.
Skills obsolescence
Skills can become obsolete due to technological changes, such as the introduction of automation in
processes. The introduction of new technologies can therefore lead to a reduction in the number of
people working in the sector. This does not seem to be happening yet, and is not expected in the
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 69

--- Page 73 ---

short term, in the agri-food sector in Morocco. The feedback received from the interviews with
companies is that no job profiles are expected to disappear in the near future. Even if the introduction
of automation in their field of activity takes place, manual activities will continue to be necessary. It
may be that some specific activities related to elementary professions (such as farmworkers and
labourers) will disappear, but employers reported that people will be relocated to different activities
and will not be replaced; this is in line with the data shown in Figure 5.4.
So far, the limited digitalisation in the sector has not affected manual work and has not replaced
people with automation; it has mainly positively affected some technical aspects that concern
measurements and in some cases data acquisition. At the same time, the introduction of
technologies helps improve working conditions: at the field level, many activities are still tiring, heavy,
and energy-consuming for manual operators, and technological solutions will reduce effort and
thereby safeguard the workers’ health.
At the field level, traditions and knowledge of a certain vintage are still considered important for
farming. The combination of traditional knowledge with a modern research approach may provide
several competitive advantages.
5.4 Main findings
■ The two main categories of job profiles with growing demand are technology-related occupations
and business services-related occupations (from sales to management). Both are impacted by
new technologies; for example, digital skills will be required for technical roles on the production
side, but also for marketing and sales profiles on the business side. All skills levels within
technology-related occupations will be affected (from high-level skills to elementary skills), while
business-related roles sensitive to the adoption of new technologies usually require a medium
level of skill.
■ New jobs and competences are emerging; some of them are new for the country, while others
are not found in occupation and skills classifications such as ESCO. In both cases, specific
competences need to be acquired by the workforce.
■ Some occupations show signs of obsolescence, such as manual or low-skilled occupations with
a relatively high level of specialisation amenable to automation. However, most of the companies
believe that the overall level of employment in agri-food will not decrease as a consequence of
the introduction of new technologies. Instead, the decline in labour-intensive occupations will be
compensated by the increase in productivity and the shift of workers to more value added tasks.
■ Companies and stakeholders value soft skills. Thus, the debate on future skills needs is not just
about technical skills but also the mix of technical and soft skills.
■ The interviews with companies pointed to the increasing relevance for high-skilled profiles
comprising multidisciplinary competences and the ability to interact with people from different
disciplinary or professional backgrounds.

6. MEETING THE CHANGES IN SKILLS
DEMAND
KEY ISSUES
■ How the changes due to the introduction of new technologies affect skills utilisation
and working conditions in the sector.
■ How businesses meet their new skills needs (e.g. via recruitment or retraining existing
workers), and the relationships they have with education and training providers.
■ Whether the education and training system is adapting sufficiently to changing skills
needs resulting from technological and other changes to meet the agri-food’s skills
needs in Morocco.
This chapter focuses on company strategies to meet their emerging skills needs. Please note that all
findings presented in this chapter are from the focus group discussion and the in-depth interviews
conducted with companies and key stakeholders (from both education and employment sides).
6.1 Constraints on technological change
Companies were asked which factors have limited the adoption of new technologies and the
development of their business. Answers were divided into two main groups: economic aspects and
the supply of skills.
For many interviewees, the main limiting factor is the high cost of new technologies and the related
insufficient investments to support technology adoption. Modern irrigation techniques, photovoltaic
solutions, greenhouses, solar dryers and precision agriculture are all technologies that many farmers
would like to introduce but lack the funds to do so. This varies to some degree according to their
position in the value chain. Employers are different from one another in their capacity to invest, with
large companies being much better placed to introduce innovations than smaller ones.
A related aspect is the role of incentives to promote the introduction of new technologies.
Government agencies have promoted the development of the agri-food sector. It was reported that
there is a division of competences between the Ministry of Agriculture (concerned with upstream
activities) and the Ministry of Industry (with downstream processes). Improved integration would be
beneficial. For agri-food companies, there are two funds which they can draw on to assist with their
development: a fund for industrial development and a fund for agricultural development. Both provide
opportunities, but for small-scale farmers it is practically difficult to obtain access to them. Concerns
were also reported about the funding of research centres and companies to jointly develop
programmes. According to some interviewees, agricultural research in Morocco tends to be
underfunded and lacks continuity of development.
Companies also pointed out that high-quality Moroccan products are usually less price competitive
than both those imported from abroad (e.g. Turkey and Egypt) and those found in the informal
market. Indeed, imported products are usually cheaper because the larger size of foreign companies
and markets allow for more economies of scale; there used to be high import duties protecting small
Moroccan producers, but with recent free trade agreements, local farmers have become less
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 71

--- Page 75 ---

competitive while at the same time the price for raw materials has increased. Regarding competition
from the informal market, the agricultural sector is defiscalised, while the agri-food sector, i.e. more
structured companies, pays taxes and value added tax (20%). Traditional producers on the informal
market that do not offer quality standards can keep prices much lower than their formal counterparts.
Furthermore, the high price of quality certifications discourages the creation of structured, controlled
and well-organised value chains.
A further factor affecting the competitiveness of the sector is its capacity to pay the wages to attract
the skills it needs. Graduate engineers, for instance, can easily find a job in Morocco but many of
them (about 25% of the total) decide to go abroad for work because the salaries are higher. And if
skilled people choose not to move abroad, they prefer to work in the public sector. Moreover, young
engineering graduates also prefer to work and live in the cities. In the rural areas where much of the
agri-food sector is located, and where there is much growth because of the Green Morocco Plan, it is
becoming difficult to find enough qualified engineers.
A second line of thought identifies the lack of competences and the shortage of qualified workers as
a factor hindering the diffusion of innovation and the development of the sector. Employers reported
that many competences discussed in the previous chapter are in short supply. Indeed, apart from
migration and salary issues, there is the issue of capacity of the education and training system: for
example, IAV Hassan II is only able to train a limited number of engineers each year, as they do not
have capacity and teachers to do more, while an existing VET track was cancelled due to lack of
resources. In general, even if there is a lack of higher education graduates, most of the problem is
linked to VET graduates, due to the limited capacity of the education systems, but also to very limited
use of laboratories and practical activities to provide the right set of skills needed by companies. R&D
capability has also been reported as a key missing aspect by various interviewees.
The gap in competences has negative consequences: farmers are unable to take advantage of the
many incentives provided by institutions and associations. For example, Fenagri developed a free-of-
charge digital platform for e-commerce, but some cooperatives were not able to access it because of
the low level of digital skills in their workforces.
It is also a matter of mindset. Because many agri-food enterprises are small (essentially
smallholdings), the approach to business is a traditional one which is not oriented or open to
innovation. It is focused on meeting short-term goals with little interest in the global market (or how
the global market might eventually affect the demand for what they produce). According to some
interviewees, even when competences are widely available and access to technology is subsidised,
change still fails to take place. For example, some farmers will not accept the introduction of new
varieties of plants because it goes against what they have been doing for years. Courses for
enhancing and updating many competences are available and the government covers around 80% of
their costs, but available technicians with diplomas in digital skills still face difficulties finding
employment.
According to some interviews, it is not so much the lack of an innovation-oriented mindset that is the
problem, but the organisation of the value chain. At present there is no clear guidance on how to
raise quality and productivity. This is required to lead small-scale farmers to use technologies that
are developed by INRA or other institutes. Small-scale farmers should be better organised. Larger
companies and cooperatives could contribute here. For example, with guidance linked to funding, the
sector would be better incentivised to take up organic farming, renewable energy, climate-smart
agriculture and environmentally friendly technologies.
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 72

--- Page 76 ---

Innovation is not restricted to technological advancements. Non-technical but systemic innovation
that the sector needs includes wider application of new technologies, training at all skills levels,
aggregation to increase productivity of smaller farms, and improved role of sectoral associations to
support small producers. In particular, this calls for special support for cooperatives to widen their
distribution.
Another factor that has emerged from the interviews is the lack of awareness of the Moroccan
population about healthy eating and environmental sustainability (despite a growing consciousness in
specific groups). The other side of the coin is that organic food costs more and is less affordable than
conventional foodstuffs.
6.2 Finding the required skills – recruitment
Recruitment strategies vary according to the level of the profile that is required and it seems that
there is no single strategy. Some businesses rely exclusively on head-hunters, while others (usually
small-scale farmers) mainly adopt word-of-mouth solutions. Other companies prefer to hire people
who work for competitors so that no training is needed as skills have already been acquired. This
‘poaching externality’, as it is sometimes referred to, is a disincentive for employers to train people. In
general, for recruitment, companies use advertisements and some employment agencies (Anapec).
The availability of skills varies by geographical area. In some regions there is an excess supply of
skills, while the opposite is true in more remote regions. In general, there are four major issues when
recruiting people with the skills required: (i) the relatively low attractiveness of the sector compared
with positions in the public sector; (ii) many highly skilled workers (including engineers) leave the
country to work abroad; (iii) in some regions, it is difficult to reach the enterprises and there is a
general preference to live and work in cities; and (iv) there is a varying level of supply coming from
the local education and training system.
Among larger enterprises, internship programmes are commonly used. Every year, students from the
more prestigious universities are sent to companies on internships: each student has a subject on
which they work during the two months they spend at the enterprise. This provides a pool from which
agri-food enterprises recruit people. In the last three years, offers to new engineering graduates have
quadrupled even if, in some cases, their skills still need to be improved.
6.3 Training strategies and opportunities
Many public institutes are present at the national level to support the strategy of the Ministry of
Agriculture; many incentives are also provided for the training of employees. Training programmes
are usually project-oriented and INRA and ONCA collaborate in developing programmes together.
GIAC helps companies define strategies for skills and competences development, while INRA
provides consultancy regarding quality issues. The government covers around 80% of the expenses
of the courses and there are several establishments which provide professional training.
Various public and private universities and engineering schools in the country offer degrees in agro-
industry engineering and technology, such as IAV Hassan II or the National School of Agriculture
(École nationale d’agriculture – ENA) in Meknès. The OFPPT offers technician-level education in
various disciplines and supports companies in reducing gaps in capacity development. Within the
Ministry of Agriculture and under the management of the Department of Education, Training and
Research (Direction de l’enseignement, de la formation et de la recherche), there are several
technician-level institutions across the country. Some of them also offer short courses to company
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 73

--- Page 77 ---

personnel for both initial education and continuing training. However, companies point out that the
curricula are sometimes too theoretical, such that new graduates have good theoretical knowledge
but less developed practical competences.
To address the skills gap, companies use a mix of strategies. Specific training can be carried out
internally in the company while continuing learning programmes are usually provided through
government support (mainly through arranged agreement with the OFPPT). In the last five years
(2015-2020), the demand from companies for continuing training has doubled, and it is increasing
every year. On the basis of annual training plans, the first set of training is usually carried out by
internal experts; for the second set, companies usually have agreements with the OFPPT so the
training is subsidised by the state. In a few cases, companies have set up internal training academies
that provide apprenticeship programmes coupling practical experience with theory. There are also
some events (such as the Cité des métiers in Agadir) or training programmes provided by ONCA (for
agriculture) and ONSSA (for industry). Some companies have internship programmes with
universities abroad (e.g. France and Spain), while others have internship programmes with schools
in Morocco; every year, some technicians are sent to engineering schools in Morocco for specific
training.
In any case, the need for training is widely acknowledged in the sector, especially for new graduates.
The common perception is that knowledge of the needs of the market, the processes and the
competitors has to be learned in the field. Thus, a period of internal apprenticeship is essential for
every new recruit, and it is carried out by people in the industry who have a deep knowledge of the
trade: ‘The problem with innovation is that it begins with the mastery of the profession’.
Many companies point out the imbalance between the training of engineers and that of technicians.
While for the former, university and training institutions are of a high level, the quality of teachers is
considered much lower when it comes to technical schools. Particularly on quality control
management and safety issues, there are several postgraduate programmes for engineers organised
by universities, but for technicians and other medium-skilled workers, major gaps in equivalent
provision remain. Various institutes have started working on the issue but the demand for
intermediate professionals is growing so fast that the training deficit persists.
Many companies organise training on quality aspects, but this needs to be followed up by continuing
training for managing and maintaining the quality control system. There are also training courses on
hygiene and quality, and technical training for different processes and logistics.
In general, companies require courses to be updated; this relates to the curricula and in increasing
the hours in the laboratory (the practical part) and time for theoretical learning.
Covid-19 has boosted the use of digital solutions for distance learning. The OFPPT recommended a
model of hybrid education, where the theoretical part is carried out online and the practical part (up to
30% of the students’ time) is undertaken in person. For the next semester, IAV Hassan II is preparing
a platform for providing the courses entirely online.
In some cases, companies state that there is a lack of schools related to specific value chains, as is
the case for example for olive oil and milk. Moreover, depending on the subject area, there are no
specific schools or universities for developing marketing and sales competences with specific
reference to the agri-food sector, and there is no background training that can be found in Morocco
specifically for R&D. However, it is worth underlining that such very specific competences could also
be developed through continuing training, work-based learning and internships as a way to adapt and
upskill workers on the sector needs and specificities.

6.4 A final word on the findings
Various good practices are being implemented in the country. The introduction of coordinated
strategies, such as the Green Morocco Plan, has helped Morocco reduce productivity gaps with other
countries. The creation of multidisciplinary agropoles, where the main institutions of the sectors are
clustered, has contributed to reducing the problem of access to international research and markets.
The new strategic plan (Génération Green) is expected to bring even more advances to the sector.
The aggregation of smaller players promoted by the Green Morocco Plan has resulted in positive
impacts on both productivity and revenues.
However, agri-food in Morocco is still structured in two segments that seem to proceed at two
different speeds: on one side a minor set of companies, mainly large ones, that produce using
modern techniques, and on the other side, the majority of small farmers still produce using traditional
means. There is also great heterogeneity, with many subsectors (some important economically,
others important from a social point of view, for instance argan production). The vision of
stakeholders is that all groups and sectors need to be supported.
A first important aspect is related to the transfer of technologies to farmers. The adoption of solutions
such as precision agriculture, modern irrigation techniques and renewable energy is definitely one of
the main drivers of development for the sector. Several incentives are available for investing in new
technologies, but their limited diffusion hints at the fact that many farmers are still not able to access
such incentives; moreover, in many cases the attitude towards innovation should change. Farmers
should be helped to raise their skills level so that they can really take advantage of new technologies.
An increased technological input would also increase the attractiveness of the sector (especially for
younger generations) and support new start-ups (as suggested in Génération Green).
A way to achieve the transfer of new technologies to farms of all sizes could be through the
aggregation model, or with cooperatives, and through the mediation of sectoral associations and
public institutions. In particular ONCA can play a relevant role, connecting with farmers and training
them on the use of new technologies. Important here will be demonstrating the benefits of investing
in new technologies such as clearly signalling the economic benefits which can be gained from, for
example, using solar power to dry food. In other words, it is about persuading producers to be more
open to innovations of one kind or another, given that the failure to change may ultimately threaten
the viability of their current businesses.
The aggregation of small farmers has been one of the key elements of the Green Morocco Plan, and
itself is an innovation. This direction should be pursued even further to promote different types of
collective organisations. For example, the economic interest group (groupement d’intérêt
économique) can play a substantial role in regional development, as they put together traditional
units that otherwise would not be able to ensure quality; however, they should be provided with more
capacity in terms of number of experts, and with incentives to compensate for higher costs than in
the informal market.
Another important direction of action relates to planning according to value chains. One of the main
challenges for the future is to enhance and diversify local products at the same time as improving the
quality of production in order to attract even more customers, at national and international levels.
More structured value chains and a better link between industry and related services and professions
will increase employment both in the agricultural sector proper and in all the other economic sectors
that interact with it: industry, energy, craft, design and marketing. In this sense, the agri-food sector
can be an important job creator since it requires different kinds of job roles, and a lot of opportunities
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 75

--- Page 79 ---

are present both at national and international level. For value chains that are not organised yet, there
is a need to tackle the issues behind the lack of organisation in order to create new employment.
Also, the shift towards market niches and higher value added crops or applications has the potential
to create additional jobs but needs to be supported with adequate measures and training. It is not
only technical skills that need to be acquired or developed, but also skills in quality management,
managerial capability and business activities. Support is also needed in terms of incentives to boost
cooperation and to develop bankable business plans.
Another area that could bring improvement to the sector is that of certification. Currently a quality
certification is issued by ONSSA and it is expected that all companies will have it by the end of 2021.
However, some constraints need to be removed. Presently, production is very heterogeneous in
terms of quality; moreover, consumers still look at the price more than the quality of the products,
and thus the informal market is a great obstacle for the development of the agri-food sector. An
awareness campaign on the healthier aspects of quality products would support the sector.
Consumers should be encouraged to buy quality products and avoid uncertified food.
Moreover, despite the general public largely being unaware of health and security concerns related
to food and food production, it is worth underlining that due to Covid-19, customers have become
and are becoming more aware of the health aspects related to food consumption. The change in
awareness of consumers means quality certifications, new technologies, and organic farming are
expected to grow even more. For organic farming, the sector needs to develop more competences in
view of its likely future growth. ONCA is responsible for transferring technologies and competences
and with the local associations must manage the transition and skills requirements.
Last but not least, green technologies, biological agriculture, agroecology agriculture and sustainable
development are new models for agribusiness that can become profitable niches for Morocco, with
benefits for both market proposition and job creation (renewable energy has been indicated
alongside irrigation of wider portions of the land as two main sources of new employment in the
country). The Ministry of Agriculture could revise education programmes to adapt to these emerging
niches, together with the OFPPT and the VET department of the Ministry of Education, in relation to
apprenticeships and private schools.
In the above-mentioned aspects too, the sector is moving at two different speeds: some farms are
evolving by adopting digital and mechanical technologies, and producing organic products, while
some other farms are smaller and still work with traditional methods. The latter have no ability to
obtain a quality certification without the support of engineers or technicians. In this sense, bigger
industries and cooperatives should help small companies in training and technology development.
Génération Green also focuses on the creation of communities inside rural areas. Future investments
could make the sector more attractive for young people, create a community of smart young farmers
that will boost the adoption of new technologies, and help the sector move towards more efficient and
productive solutions. According to the interviews, in part this is already happening in some areas of
the country.
It is hoped that these findings will raise awareness of policy-makers and practitioners about the
changing skills needs in the agri-food sector and provide food for thought especially in relation to the
ability of the education and training system to address these changes and to prepare workers to be fit
for the new jobs and occupations.

Possible specific actions could include the following.
■ adopt an integrated vision and push for greater convergence between agriculture (upstream) and
food processing (downstream), and integration between the authorities responsible for the
constituent parts of the agri-food sector;
■ make greater investments in R&D to address the forthcoming challenges such as climate
change and capture high value added segments of the market;
■ structure interventions at the value chain level, and remove factors behind the lack of
organisation in certain value chains, in order to create new employment. Large companies,
cooperatives and institutions can support the small players and transfer know-how on the basis
of the specific needs of the chain, fostering the adoption of technologies, new management
models, access to funding, and quality control and certification;
■ create collective organisations (or boost existing ones) that are able to aggregate or involve the
largest possible number of small farms and guide them towards a path of improvement in terms
of enhancing the value of production; favouring a change of mindset about innovation and the
need to be competitive in order to survive and thrive; and adopting new technologies and
business models, also through technology transfer. Cooperatives could be one possible model to
be scaled up, assuming that training is granted at all skills levels, as aggregation aims to
increase productivity and quality, and aims to establish more structured value chains. Sectoral
associations should be equipped to support small producers and special support should be
granted to cooperatives to expand distribution;
■ improve the organisation and control of value chains to reduce the use of the informal market;
■ incentivise the formal market through ad-hoc policies to raise consumers’ awareness about
higher quality and healthier products;
■ enable a better understanding of companies’ needs through more specific diagnostic studies
with indications of specific occupational profiles required and additional training. This would have
implications on occupational standards in the country, with the need to revise documents that
describe tasks and activities and specify performance requirements to attain competence in the
different occupations. Social partners, ministries, experts, providers and other interested
stakeholders would need to review them, looking at implications for existing related qualifications
and/or the need to identify new ones;
■ enhance the training curricula, especially in VET schools, with more laboratories for practical
activities and at the same time more digital tools for more efficient content delivery. There is also
the need to expand the competences on internationalisation (e.g. laws and regulations, trade
agreements, quality requirements, digital and traditional marketing techniques), given the
growing focus on exports;
■ revise education programmes to adapt to new emerging niches and in particular to those related
to green and sustainable economy such as agroecology or renewable energies;
■ create new, dedicated vocational schools to develop specific value chains, intermediate
professional figures on specific competences, and agricultural R&D activities. Possible best
practices to explore and expand on are the training institutes set up by sectoral federations in
collaboration with international and national counterparts; for example, the Institut de formation
de l’industrie meunière has trained more than 400 technicians specialised in milling activities;
■ enhance continuing training and reskilling and upskilling as a way to ensure workers are
adaptable to rapidly changing skills needs in their jobs and to give them tools to transit to new
job opportunities. In this, cooperation with the private sector (with the establishment of specific
public–private partnerships, as is already happening in some sectors) is key, together with the
reinforcement of work-based learning practices and internships.

6.5 Main findings
■ There are various factors which may constrain growth in the agri-food sector, from those related
to the cost of introducing new technologies (and the estimated returns), to those related to the
availability of skills needed to use new technologies.
■ The mindset in some of the more traditional agri-food enterprises (small-scale farms, often not
part of existing cooperatives or other aggregation mechanisms) is such that they are largely
unaware of the need to introduce new technologies.
■ Recruiting people with the skills needed to adapt to technological change can prove difficult for
the following reasons: (a) the relatively low attractiveness of the sector compared with positions
in the public sector; (b) many highly skilled workers (including engineers) leave the country to
work abroad; (c) in some regions, it is hard to reach the agri-food enterprises and there is a
general preference for living and working in cities; and (d) there is a varying level of supply
coming from the local education and training system.
■ Companies follow various strategies to find the skills they need, ranging from recruiting new
graduates from universities after an internship, to recruitment through head-hunters and also
using job advertisement campaigns. For smaller enterprises, word of mouth is also a solution.
■ The subsectors do have links with the education and training system, but employers report that
schools are not able to provide all the competences required by the industry.
■ Companies try to compensate for skills gaps in their workforces by widening their training
strategies, e.g. by providing in-house learning, mentoring and on-the-job training, or using
external organisations to secure training, or even setting up their own internal academies and
training centres.
■ Private actors in the sector pointed out that to allow the entire sector to grow, more specific
professional schools (from the value chain of oil to that of milk production) are needed. In
parallel, the enhancement of continuing training and reskilling and upskilling is essential to
ensure sector-specific skills and make workers adaptable to new emerging needs.

GLOSSARY
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a general term used to describe a variety of technologies and
approaches that allow computers to solve complex tasks (usually associated with higher cognitive
levels), for example: recognition of objects or patterns; classification of entities; simulation and
modelling of situations; predictions of future behaviours; and generation of constructs similar to
existing ones.
Cognitive bias is a systematic pattern of deviation from the norm or rationality in judgement.
Cognitive biases are considered by many authors as linked to the normal functioning of the human
brain and thus can arise in any activity involving human judgement.
Competence means ‘the proven ability to use knowledge, skills and personal, social and/or
methodological abilities, in work or study situations and in professional and personal development’
(European Qualifications Framework). While sometimes used as synonyms, the terms skill and
competence can be distinguished according to their scope. The term skill refers typically to the use of
methods or instruments in a particular setting and in relation to defined tasks. The term competence
is broader and refers typically to the ability of a person – facing new situations and unforeseen
challenges – to use and apply knowledge and skills in an independent and self-directed way.
Cross-sector knowledge, skills or competences is one of the four levels of skills reusability
identified by the ESCO initiative, whereby reusability means how widely a knowledge, skills or
competence concept can be applied in different working contexts. Cross-sector knowledge is
relevant to occupations across several economic sectors, whereas sector-specific or occupation-
specific knowledge is restricted to one specific sector or occupation. See also transversal
knowledge.
Cross-sector technology – adopting the cross-sector concept from ESCO’s skills reusability
levels, the term indicates a technology that finds application in many different economic sectors (e.g.
control units or sensors).
ESCO is the multilingual classification of European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and
Occupations. ESCO works as a dictionary, describing, identifying and classifying professional
occupations, skills and qualifications relevant for the EU labour market and education and training,
in a format that can be understood by electronic systems. It lists over 3 000 occupations and 13 000
skills and competences. For more info, see https://ec.europa.eu/esco/portal/home.
ISCO stands for International Standard Classification of Occupations and is an International Labour
Organisation classification structure for organising information on labour and jobs. It is part of the
international family of economic and social classifications of the United Nations. It contains around
7 000 detailed jobs, organised in a four-level hierarchy that allows all jobs in the world to be classified
into groups, from 436 lower-level groups up to 10 major groups.
Job is a set of tasks and duties performed, or meant to be performed, by one person (ISCO-08).
Job profile is the description of a particular work function, developed by the employer or by the
human resources department of a company, that includes all the elements deemed necessary to
perform the corresponding job. In particular, it includes general tasks, duties and responsibilities, and
required qualifications, competences and skills needed by the person in the job.
THE FUTURE OF SKILLS – MOROCCO | 81

Job title is the identifying label given by the employer to a specific job, usually when looking for new
candidates to the position. In the absence of standardised nomenclature, it can coincide with either a
description of the job or the occupation group the job belongs to.
NACE (Nomenclature statistique des activités économiques dans la Communauté européenne
[Statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community]) is a four-digit
classification providing the framework for collecting and presenting a large range of statistical data
according to economic activity in the fields of economic statistics, provided by Eurostat. Economic
activities are divided into 10 or 11 categories at high-level aggregation, while they are divided into
38 categories at intermediate aggregation.
Natural language processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of linguistics,
computer science and information engineering. NLP deals with the interactions between computers
and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyse
large amounts of natural language data, starting from the identification of the grammatical and logical
parts of speech within a sentence, up to the complex representation of semantic relationships
between words.
O*NET stands for Occupational Information Network, a free online database of occupational
requirements and worker attributes. At the time of writing, the online database contains 1 016
occupational titles, each with standardised and occupation-specific descriptors, covering the entire
US economy. It describes occupations in terms of the skills and knowledge required, how the work is
performed, and typical work settings. It can be used by businesses, educators, jobseekers and
human resources professionals. It is a program to facilitate the development and maintenance of a
skilled workforce, developed under the sponsorship of the US Department of Labour/Employment
and Training Administration (USDOL/ETA). For more info, see www.onetcenter.org/ and
www.onetonline.org/.
Occupation – according to ESCO, an occupation is ‘a grouping of jobs involving similar tasks, and
which require a similar skill set’. Occupations should not be confused with jobs or job titles. While a
job is bound to a specific work context and executed by one person, occupations group jobs by
common characteristics (for example, being the ‘project manager for the development of the
ventilation system of the Superfly 900 aircraft’ is a job; ‘project manager’, ‘aircraft engine specialist’ or
‘heating, ventilation, air conditioning engineer’ could be occupations, i.e. groups of jobs, to which this
job belongs).
Occupational profile is an explanation of the occupation in the form of description, scope,
definition, and list of the knowledge, skills and competences considered relevant for it. Each
occupation in the ESCO database also comes with an occupational profile that further distinguishes
between essential and optional knowledge, skills and competences.
Profession – an occupation requiring a set of specific skills and dedicated training.
Qualification is the ‘formal outcome of an assessment and validation process which is obtained
when a competent body determines that an individual has achieved learning outcomes to given
standards’ (European Qualifications Framework).
Regulated profession – a profession is called regulated if its access, scope of practice, or title is
regulated by law.

Semantic matching is a technique used in computer science to identify information which is
semantically related.
Skill means ‘the ability to apply knowledge and use know-how to complete tasks and solve problems’
(European Qualifications Framework). Skills can be described as cognitive (involving the use of
logical, intuitive and creative thinking) or practical (involving manual dexterity and the use of
methods, materials, tools and instruments). While sometimes used as synonyms, the terms skill and
competence can be distinguished according to their scope. See competence for more details.
Soft skills are usually associated with transversal skills and are considered the cornerstone for
personal development, also within the context of labour and employment. To distinguish them from
other knowledge-based basic skills, they are often referred to as social or emotional skills. They can
be further classified into personal skills (e.g. problem-solving and adaptability) or interpersonal ones
(e.g. teamwork and leadership).
Text mining is a general term indicating a variety of techniques that allow computers to extract,
discover or organise relevant information from large collections of different written resources, such as
websites, books and articles. The first part of any text mining process implies the transformation of
texts in structured representations useful for subsequent analysis through the use of NLP tools.
Sometimes AI techniques are used to perform text mining tasks more effectively.
Transversal knowledge, skills or competences is the highest of the four levels of skills reusability
identified by the ESCO initiative. Transversal skills are relevant to a broad range of occupations and
sectors. They are often referred to as core skills, basic skills or soft skills, the cornerstone for the
personal development of a person. Transversal knowledge, skills and competences are the building
blocks for the development of the ‘hard’ skills and competences required to succeed in the labour
market.
Transversal technology, adopting the transversal concept from ESCO’s skills reusability levels, is
relevant to a broad range of occupations and sectors and is a building block for more specific
technologies (e.g. computerised image analysis).
